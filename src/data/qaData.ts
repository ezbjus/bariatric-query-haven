    title: "How Do I Get Over The Mental Block Of Not Wanting To Drink My Protein Shakes Because I'M Tired Of Them?",
    question: "I think of a fair life chocolate shake and I want to gag. But I need it. I'm only getting small amounts of protein from yogurt. What can I do? I've heard about those shots that contain 17g of protein, are those a good idea?",
    answer: "Get some unflavored protein powder and add it into other beverages soups or your pur√©ed foods",

    title: "Can Someone Help Me Understand Bmr?",
    question: "I had VSG 10/3 at 325lbs. At that point my BMR was 1238. I've since lost 50lbs, and my BMR has gone up to 1460. Wouldn't a smaller body = fewer caloric needs?",
    answer: "BmR is your metabolic rate. It's how fast your body is burning energy storage ...so faster is better. Instead of the cheap easy energy of a carb heavy diet...by focusing on protein..your body has to work more to get the energy out of protein ...so your body is adapting to the new normal",

    title: "My Nerves Need To Calm Down!",
    question: "Early tomorrow morning I'll be breaking up with my current stomach. I have been fine on the liquid diet and have prepared as much as possible. I thank you all for sharing so many great tips and encouragement ! I don't know exactly why I am vibrating with crazy nerves. I don't live near my family. Other than my husband, daughter and a few close friends and maybe that sweet cashier at my often frequented Goodwill, I haven't told anyone. I don't want to hear them try to talk me out and tell me horror stories. Still, I feel bad not telling them. I don't think my nerves are too do with that, it's just anxiety about the pain, possible complications and the huge changes. I just hope I do everything right because there's so much to learn. If you're a praying person, I would really appreciate the prayers. üòâ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è",
    answer: "Focus on what you're gaining rather than what you're giving up. Create new traditions - for example, instead of food-centered activities, try new hobbies or ways to celebrate. Remember that you can still participate in social events, just in different ways. Many patients find that the health benefits and improved quality of life far outweigh any temporary feelings of missing out.",
