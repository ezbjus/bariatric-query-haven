    "question": "Alright me again wife had vsg last Wednesday the 18th of December. Anyone have no issues? Maybe she‚Äôs built differently but she has no pain is having normal bowl movements even on colace it‚Äôs not watery. Says she doesn‚Äôt have to push poop. Also she says she doesn‚Äôt feel the clogged sink feeling the dr mentioned or hasn‚Äôt felt full yet. Anyone else experience this? She‚Äôs getting in almost all her liquids in for the day and yesterday she had 30grams of protein. Which isn‚Äôt enough but says she doesn‚Äôt feel full. Also yesterday was the first time she said she was feeling hungry.",
    "answer": "I had a smooth recovery. Able to get in all the protein and fluids daily. It took a couple of months to get clogged up, after really being back on solid foods. Just have her take stool softners daily for a while. To keep myself regular, I use a benefiber packet in my coffee each morning. I drink cafe bustelo, so thats helpful as well, haha. I normally have 2 cups a day. Just stay on top of eating/drinking fiber/coffee or taking miralax. Stay ahead of the issue. I didnt, and got hemorrhoids for the first time in my life.

    "question": "Hi, I was sleeved 6 months ago and I‚Äôm 64 pounds down. I was 331 and now I‚Äôm 265. People who weigh less get this surgery from what I have seen online recently. And I‚Äôm just worried I won‚Äôt lose enough weight to get to my goal which is 170. I feel like if I got the bypass, I would‚Äôve been ok, but I don‚Äôt know. I just hope this wasn‚Äôt all for nothing. My doctor told me to get this specific surgery and until after I got it, I didn‚Äôt realize that people who are under 300 pounds usually get the sleeve and lose the most weight. Has anyone else experienced this and do you think I still have a chance to lose the weight?",

    "title": "Thoughts On Volume",
    "question": "Hoping to get a little bit of clarity here and some opinions.\n \n On surgery day I weighed 380 and I am now down to 299 6 months in.\n \n Over the past month I have had a couple of large vacations and have definitely laxed but have by no means gained more than the few pounds of water, weight and pounds of weight you expect to gain on long vacations. I have. I came back and weighed in at 305 and quickly and back down to my 299 mark and have no worries about continuing my journey.\n \n I did have one odd moment though where I did not eat anything in the morning and one of my colleagues offered to purchase me a Jimmy John's sandwich. For contacts, I always order a turkey tom with no cheese and light mayonnaise with lettuce and onion.\n \n Surprisingly, I was able to eat the whole thing, although the last bite that went down was rather uncomfortable.\n \n I look back and think that in my old days, I could easily eat two subs from there with a bag of chips and a cookie and still have room to eat. I think of now and think that the sub 8 was only 480 calories and even though I could eat the entire thing, he filled me up and I felt content until that evening's dinner.\n \n If I look back on my sleeve I have yet to challenge it to this point and I'm worried that it is stretched out.\n \n I'm shooting from the hip here and just thinking out loud as I really could use some people's input.\n \n Again, I want to make everyone aware that I am not sitting here stretching out my sleeve every night by overeating, I as does everyone, has an occasional bad day but by no means am I stretching my sleeve to the point where I am hurting.\n \n Just typing this out make me feel a little bit better but would like to get everyone else's input.\n \n I understand that stretching is normal and the way that I gauge my stomach capacity is how much of a 16 oz water bottle I can drink one sip comfortably. Right now I can get about just under half of the water bottle down before feeling discomfort.\n \n Thanks in advance to all of your help and time. I look forward to posting my 7-month updates once we hit the 100 lb mark!",
    "answer": "At six months it would be incredibly difficult to stretch your pouch out to the point that it‚Äôs concerning. As the self-proclaimed Stomach Stretching Queen on this sub, I had to binge for nearly two years straight to reach a point where I was fully stretched/needed a re-sleeve. Vacations and not being 100% diligent all the time won‚Äôt do that. Vacations are the times where you should truly enjoy the pleasures of food that go beyond nutrition!! Being able to down that sandwich may have been just an odd day (I know my stomach seems like it‚Äôs sewn back on during my cycle) or your new limit. It‚Äôs such an odd learning process, isn‚Äôt it? Congrats on your weight loss by the way :) you‚Äôre doing great! Looking forward to your 7 month update :) "

    "question": "I used reddit a lot to read about similar experiences, hopefully my diary is useful to someone. For context I‚Äôm 32F, 5‚Äô1‚Äù, SW 250lb. My diet consisted of water, water with crystal light, 3 protein shakes a day and bariatric vitamins. From day 3 to 10 I also chewed sugar free gum since my surgeon allowed it. I consumed less than 500 calories a day and lost about 10lb, which might be a reflection of my PCOS and slow metabolism. Goes to show not everybody will shed tons of weight right away.\n \n Pre op diet\n \n Day 1 - excited to start this phase, feeling like the surgery is getting more real everyday. Didn‚Äôt really have any difficulties besides the fact that not chewing anything felt weird.\n \n Day 2 - while I was standing at work, I was sweating profusely. When sitting down, I felt weak and dizzy. Didn‚Äôt really feel hungry, just felt very sick.\n \n Day 3 - day off from work, felt very tired all day, took a 1 hour nap in the middle of the day which is something I never do. Woke up starving after dreaming of food and gobbled down my protein shake.\n \n Day 4 - was very disappointed to learn I only lost 400g since yesterday, from the way my stomach is gurgling non stop it feels like I should be losing at least 1kg a day. At work, someone passed by me carrying hospital food trays to be delivered to patients and it smelled like a gourmet restaurant.\n \n Day 5 - was doing good and not really feeling hungry until I saw a portuguese roll salami and provolone sandwich someone left at work‚Äôs locker room, my mouth immediately started salivating and the hunger pangs came back. I also dreamed that I had only lost 100g. Felt increasingly worse during the day, had a migraine and left work early. Was craving a regular plate of food REALLY bad.\n \n Day 6 - had a very vivid dream, not sure if that has anything to do with the diet or not. Overall, today was fine, I didn‚Äôt really crave any food to my surprise and I wasn‚Äôt excessively tired like I have been lately. Only problem is that I pooped a brick, this might be the constipation starting, will probably start fiber gummies.\n \n Day 7 - I surprisingly felt okay, no hunger pangs and although I craved a juicy steak at night (and Im not a regular meat eater), I was okay with just the protein shakes. Started Miralax for constipation per surgeon‚Äôs advice.\n \n Day 8 - again felt fine, no hunger, feeling satiated enough with the shakes. Once again had an extremely vivid dream. Miralax seemed to help with pooping at first but towards the end of the night I started having diarrhea so I think I won‚Äôt take it again.\n \n Day 9 - seems like my body is used to such low calories now, another okay day. just craved a burger at night but I was watching food videos so that‚Äôs probably my fault. Had diarrhea in the morning again, stopped Miralax.\n \n Day 10 - felt fine, no cravings, a bit constipated but no diarrhea, another vivid dream.\n \n Day 11 - felt very tired at work, couldn‚Äôt wait to go home and lay down. No craving at all, just feeling exhausted, didn‚Äôt poop.\n \n Day 12 - normal pooping is back on track, feeling tired, otherwise no issues.\n \n Day 13 - felt very tired all day long, not feeling like I lost enough weight (about 10lb) even though I‚Äôve been living off water and protein shakes, starting to get nervous for the surgery.\n \n Day 14 - just woke up but another exhausted day, I can tell. Im glad to be done with this step and ready for the surgery, Im definitely getting nervous now. My overall reflection of the pre op diet is that the beginning is definitely a lot harder but the body does get used to it. Im not in a hurry to start normal food again, if anything I feel like following this diet became an easy and safe habit. In the beginning it felt like this diet would be a looong never ending challenge, now it feels like 14 days literally flew by.",

    "title": "Gastric Sleeve Experience Questions",
    "question": "Has anyone had the sleeve for just weight purposes (excessively high weight but no other diagnosed conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure/ hypertension, etc)? If so, what has been your experience? Any issues or things you would do differently? Also, has anyone else started around my SW (524lbs)? What's your experience been?\n \n ( I am in the pre-op process, eat generally healthy - although too much from what I see after tracking calories lol - and don't have any of the usual comorbidities (no diabetes, high blood pressure, etc), but SW was 524lbs (I'm 5'4\") and have struggled with my weight since I was a child). Thanks! :)",
    "answer": "Excess weight very much does cause health consequences in terms of body stress and inflammation, so there are absolutely issues brewing below the surface. The fact that a ticking bomb hasn‚Äôt exploded doesn‚Äôt make it less dangerous. You have co-morbidities, but you haven‚Äôt met them yet‚Ä¶ at that size, your body is one twisted ankle away from meeting several at once. Phrasing it the way you have is a super careful way of arguing that you‚Äôre ‚Äúmostly fine except for this one major life issue that affects everything else‚Äù. EVERYBODY IS HERE BECAUSE OF THEIR WEIGHT. Zero people are like ‚ÄúI just want to be skinny and I don‚Äôt my care that my quality of life, longevity, and overall health would be improved.‚Äù You‚Äôll even find a whole contingent of people who specifically state that they are ONLY here because of their ‚Äúhealth‚Äù and are irate that their bodies will have to shrink to help with that. They claim to want to keep their size/shape but fix their blood pressure. It can get very weird out there. People come at this from a lot of directions/reasons but it‚Äôs all the same in the operating room. Bypass, duodenal switch, or SADI are typically suggested for your weight range (or VSG as a phase 1 for bypass). Sleeve is only restrictive and the others also reduce nutrient/calorie intake by malabsorption. Is your surgeon worried about keeping you under for the longer time it would take for those other options?  Irene_Adler91 It wasn't meant as a dig or an I'm better than you kind of post, I was just clarifying because most posts I have come across so far they have mentioned having another condition in addition to the weight. I was just seeing if there was someone who had a similar set of circumstances. I am aware that it could be just a matter of time, which is why I have done other things to help stave them off and why I am in the process of getting the surgery.  In talking with my surgeon and doing my own research, we came to the conclusion that the sleeve would be my best option.  "

    "answer": "I'm six weeks PO and I had a glass of Pinot Noir at dinner Saturday. Everything was fine. First and foremost, you should follow the instructions of your surgical team. But if you're determined to not do that...I think it all depends greatly on the person. I have had zero issues tolerating anything since surgery. Everything has been absolute clockwork. So I felt comfortable having a glass and taking it real slow. If that's not the case for you, you probably shouldn't risk it! There are numerous reasons we are told to avoid alcohol - first for safety but also to not fuck up our progress. If you're a drinker in general, you probably definitely shouldn't drink \"like you used to.\" But do I think a few glasses of Pinot a week are going to be my undoing? I do not. Be careful friend! "

    "question": "Hi all!\n \n I lost 44 lbs from. 10/23 to 22/12 (surgery date 12/16) which for me is almost a miracle after 4 years of useless diets. Since my surgery i drop 11 pounds which is amazing cause im still very swollen and bloated with fluids. Today, I have lost two sizes of clothing, three sizes in some stores, I am aware that my body has changed but I still can't look at myself in the mirror, it disgusts me, I look away as quickly as I can after putting on clothes. I have consulted my therapist and he tells me to give it time, that its something that will go away on its own, that it happens to a lot of people and with time it will go away, is that so? Does it happen to you too? Did it go away with time?\n \n On the other hand, a couple of days ago I posted that I felt dizzy and shaky since my third day after surgery, everyone told me it was because of my low liquid consumption (I don't drink more than 36-40oz) however, after being admitted to the emergency room at night due to my general malaise, dizziness and shaking it was discovered that I am perfectly hydrated with those 36 oz and if I can't, I simply don't take any more, my problem is that now I suffer from hypoglycemia and I have to inject insulin, I entered with 44mg/dL, has it happened to anyone that after surgery they need insulin? It has been happening to me since the third day but the dizziness lasted longer and longer until this nighttime when I would literally faint, I couldn't move my legs or lift my head, everything was spinning and I turned pale.",

    "question": "Reposting this to hopefully get an answer:\n \n Hello all.\n \n I got the sleeve done almost 5 months ago and I've done well so far. Have lost about 65 pounds, only regained during one particularly bad week and I've never had any bad reactions to food or thrown up or anything like that.\n \n However, I've run into a problem, and that is my water intake. I used to drink water in chugs pre-op. Like, I would drink an entire water bottle within one minute and then do another right after. I'd do this two or three times a day to make sure i got my water intake. Of course, with the sleeve, that's not really possible. However, I have been drinking water faster than i probably should now. I'll drink a full water bottle in about 20 minutes. I take a drink of like 3 ounces and wait a minute or two and then drink again. It doesn't really hurt or anything, and the only sign I ever get to slow down is that I'll start burping(and this rarely happens), and I slow down after that. It's the only way I can get all the water intake I need. If I drink water the way I drink everything else (takes me like an hour and a half to drink my morning coffee), I'd never get enough in my system.\n \n Does drinking water this way stretch the pouch?

    "question": "I am so embarrassed rn but my surgery is scheduled on 12/26. My surgeon told me to do a 2-week diet of 2 shakes and 1 lean and green, with clear liquids for 2 days before surgery. I didn‚Äôt follow it very strictly on the first week and i ate a few bad things but in small amounts. It‚Äôs been a struggle with all the food and snacks people have been bringing into my job because of Christmas lol. throughout the week I cheated and ate a mini bag of chips and some small slices of pizza. Even on days I didn‚Äôt cheat, I most likely ate more calories that recommended.\n \n I was really consistent today and will be for the rest of the days leading up but i am super nervous about them canceling the surgery if my liver hasn‚Äôt shrunk. I have definitely reduced my usual calorie intake and the way i usually eat but i am still worried. Everything has been paid for through my work insurance which will no longer be available January 1st. I can not afford it on my own. Do you think it is possible to shrink my liver enough with following the diet strictly and doing the 2 days of clear liquids? Should I even be worried? Any tips?",
    "answer": "‚Ä¢ The preop diet plan really is important beyond liver shrinking but did your surgeon tell you to lose x amount of weight prior to the surgery. Did they emphasize that you specifically must shrink your liver? I think you‚Äôll be fine unless they specified that you specifically really needed to shrink your liver. some surgeons will just make more incisions to gain better access to the stomach if the liver is still too large/thick. So if you see more than 5 incisions post op that could be a reason why (among other reasons like hernias, gallbladder, etc). Anywho, my preop diet was 2 weeks through thanksgiving until 12/06. So it was hard seeing everyone eat as well! And I could only have shakes, Greek yogurt, and the occasional 1/2 cup of oatmeal or grits only. But I am glad I didn‚Äôt cheat the preop diet because it really lessened the blow of the inevitable mental post op struggles since I was already used to the shakes. I‚Äôm just over 2 weeks PO now and let me tell you, the hunger and food noise was still very real early on. Especially after day 4ish. And you can‚Äôt eat a slice or even a few bites of pizza 4 days post op. I mean you can try but there‚Äôs a high chance you‚Äôll end up in the ER lol. Anyways.

    "title": "Pain/Discomfort When Swallowing",
    "question": "I am 25days post op gastric sleeve. Since the beginning I feel discomfort/pain on my throat down to my stomach as I swallow the food I eat, I feel the food coming down to my oesophagus to the stomach. I use a teaspoon to eat on a small bowl or plate so I don't think my portions are big. I chew 20-30 times before I swallow and wait 1-2 minutes before each bite. The wrong thing I did is that for the past 3 weeks I am mostly liquid diet, when I started pur√©ed diet I only eat egg and cheese once a day and just drink protein shakes the whole day. I'm thinking the reason I feel this still is maybe I'm still not used to solid foods but what I'm wondering is why do I feel the pain/discomfort from my throat down to my chest when the only area I had surgery is the stomach. Because of this I barely eat solids I am nearly 4 weeks post op and I mostly just drink protein shakes and fluids. Anyone has experienced this? Any tips on how to get over this?",
    "answer": "Yes, the surgery was on your stomach, but your esophagus takes a bit of a beating. During the surgery, there is a special tool that the surgeon uses that goes in your mouth, down your esophagus and inside your stomach. This tool helps guide the surgeon from the inside of your stomach and helps them size your stomach correctly. Alone, this tool wouldn‚Äôt cause much irritation, but you are also under general anesthesia, so you‚Äôre intubated. Which means there‚Äôs another tube that goes down your trachea. So during surgery your esophagus is getting pressure from the inside and the outside (since the trachea and esophagus sit next to each other). Your esophagus after surgery is super inflamed and irritated. It takes a while for that irritation to go away. It does sound like yours is lasting longer than most. Most people don‚Äôt experience any throat soreness after the first week. Now, everyone experiences pain differently, and it might be that you‚Äôre just more sensitive to this discomfort than most people. Which means that this is just something you have to suck it up and power through and eventually you‚Äôll get over it. But I would bring it up to your surgeon and see what they say. As I said, discomfort in your throat this far out is unusual. So you want to check with your surgeon that it‚Äôs not something to be worried about. "

    "title": "I Want The Sleeve But Not Sure I‚ÄôM ‚ÄúUnhealthy‚Äù Enough",
    "question": "I am considering getting the sleeve but I am afraid I‚Äôm not unhealthy enough. I‚Äôm 28F 5‚Äô 7‚Äù and currently weigh 241. BMI around 37.\n \n Background, my highest weight was 266 in 2018. I was able to lose about 30 pounds naturally with tracking macros and exercise. However, I was unable to keep the weight off. By 2022, I was back to around 250 and my PCP started me on Qysmia. I lost roughly 30 pounds but the topiramate in Qysmia was terrible for my mental health. After quitting Qysmia, gained about 10-15 pounds and I stayed around 230. I tried contrave but I didn‚Äôt lose any weight on it but also didn‚Äôt gain. So I quit taking that as well.\n \n I stay pretty consistent with working out by running and lifting heavy weights. However, at the beginning of the year, I sprained my ACL playing volleyball. I haven‚Äôt been able to consistently run or do any leg related weight training due to to knee pain. I am doing physical therapy for my knee. Although, nutrition has been decent, I have gained about 11 pounds and currently weigh 241. I restarted phentermine but still haven‚Äôt lost anymore. I have an INSATIABLE hunger that is what makes it hard to keep weight off.\n \n Since embarking on this weight loss journey, I have been following up with my PCP every 3 months. At my last visit with my PCP she asked if I would ever consider the sleeve as my insurance will not cover GLP1 medications. I am considering getting it as I cannot seem to keep weight off. However, even though my BMI is considered morbidly obese‚Ä¶ I currently do not have any obesity related comorbidities. My lab work is great. Other than excess weight I would be considered ‚Äúhealthy.‚Äù But I also don‚Äôt want to get to the point of being ‚Äúunhealthy.‚Äù\n \n My biggest fear on wanting to get the surgery is what others will think. My second fear is that I am not considered unhealthy enough to get it. What if me getting it is seen as vain? üòÖ Lastly, I am afraid that if I go through with it, I will lose significant strength and lifting heavy is something that brings me joy.\n \n Has anyone else had reservations about getting the surgery? I have a follow up with my PCP in January and plan to discuss the sleeve.",
    "answer": "I had my surgery at a BMI of 36 with minor comorbidities. I wasn't sick, but my weight had been yoyoing for over 30 years. I kept a consistent exercise plan and still do. I went through many dietary plans, and nothing worked for sustainability or weight maintenance. I took topiramate as well and continued to yoyo. My mental health was in the trash. Enough was enough, so I had surgery even though my PCP at the time wasn't thrilled. I'm down 70 lbs after a year and a half. Glad I didn't wait anymore.  youthinkyouknowme234 That‚Äôs what I am tired of is the constant back and forth between losing and gaining.

Plus I‚Äôve already had 2 weight checks with my PCP. I see my surgeon again next month and have my upper GI XRay. When should I expect to be given a surgery date?",
    "answer": "In the US, typically when you finish your final prerequisite for surgery, you‚Äôll call your surgeon‚Äôs office and schedule an appointment with your surgeon to go over the results of all of your tests and finalize any last steps. That appointment is typically when you get your surgery date. Some programs might wait until they have approval from your insurance before scheduling surgery. If you want a more definite timeline, call your surgical office and ask. They should be able to tell you what the next steps are for you getting your date and estimate how long those steps will take.

The one thing that is the most relieving and makes me super happy is my capacity for liquids. I feel like I'm able to take 3 large sips no problem and drink 16 Oz in about 15 minutes.

Your body is still producing the same amount of acid, but it doesn‚Äôt realize your stomach is now 1/5 its original size (smaller actually right now because it‚Äôs still so swollen).

    "question": "Hi everyone!\n \n I'm a 31-year-old woman from Chicago, and I had gastric sleeve surgery in March 2016. I've lost over 100 pounds since then, but I've regained about 30 that I‚Äôm determined to lose before my wedding in October 2025.\n \n I'm posting because I‚Äôve noticed there isn‚Äôt a lot of information about long-term life after surgery. How do you all manage calorie tracking? How many calories do you aim for each day?\n \n Also, if anyone is local to Chicago, I‚Äôd love to connect and build a supportive community of others who have gone through this journey!",
    "answer": "There's not much out there about long-term post-op life because there's not much special about it. Weight loss works the same way it does for everyone else: track calories. If you want to lose weight, eat fewer calories. Don't based your calorie intake on online calculators because there's too much variance in metabolisms for them to be useful. Don't expect dieting to work in the long term because dieting doesn't work for the vast majority of people in the long term. Eat the most satiating foods (lean protein, foods that are solid at body temperature) and avoid the least satiating (liquids, simple carbs). Avoid drinking during or after meals since fluids will push food past the upper stomach, which detects what one has eaten, more quickly. Exercise is wonderful for general health but is not an effective way to lose weight. I personally use MacroFactor for tracking my food because it automatically handles setting new macro targets based on my intake, my weight, and my goal. My target is roughly 2,400 estimated calories/day. "

    "question": "Hello folks - I'm 35M, current weight 122kgs and height 6ft. I've been obese throughout my life and lost and gained back weight many times in my life. My healthy weight is 90kgs. In May 2023 at 145kgs weight, I got completely fed up and registered for gastric sleeve.\n \n I now have surgery scheduled in Feb 2025. I'm based in Canada so the surgery is free and cost is not a concern. Apart from my weight and knee pain due to weight, I'm generally in good health and have changed my diet drastically over the last 18 months loosing 23 kgs but have now been on a plateau for a few months. I workout regularly and do other activities.\n \n My main motivation for surgery is as a prevention tactic to avoid getting diabetes, more joints trouble and any other diseases that come with being obese. During appointments doctor told me if you don't get surgery you will 100% be dealing with diabetes and other health issues.\n \n I'm just really confused if I need to be taking this step right now. I'm feeling this obviously involves huge lifestyle changes and is a big surgery in itself. I've already succeeded in getting some weight off, maybe I should continue trying and only go for surgery in case I actually develop other problems. But at the same time I'm still 32 kgs over my healthy weight which is no small amount.\n \n Feeling really confused and looking to insights from other folks similar to my situation who did or didn't go for surgery and how you fared.

I was sleeved this September (~ 3 months, current bmi is 30) and while the weight loss etc. is going well, recently I feel like it's a little harder for me to get full satisfying breaths in (sometimes also referred to as air hunger). It's mostly just uncomfortable and it's not like I'm gasping for air or anything. It almost feels like I can't physically expand my abdomen as before? Like imagine if you sucked in your stomach and then tried to take a deep breath in - that's kind of what it feels like. Not sure if anyone noticed these kinds of physical changes?\n \n I notice it most when I'm walking/doing low impact exercise or after I eat which makes sense but I've also started noticing it at other times of the day as well. I also have anxiety and am medicated for it but I was wondering if anyone else experienced this during their journey and how they adjusted.\n \n I've talked to my doctor about it and we're doing a blood test to figure out any deficiencies (especially since I used to be anemic).

    "question": "",
    "answer": "Depends on your goal and definition of \"enough\".  What you are doing now is incredible for you so you are already ahead of the curve.  Could you increase by doing light cardio in between? Yes that's called active rest where you aren't pushing yourself but still active however the most important thing is consistency so I would focus more on what you've already accomplished into your routine and maintain that routine for about 6 weeks before trying to push it.  If you feel the need to push it, than increase slowly.  Maybe of those 4/7 days at the gym go for a walk on 1 or 2 of your days off.  Just increase gently and make it a part of your routine before increasing further. Edit: most important thing I learned was it's not how much you can do but how often you can do it.  If you are sore every day, you are over training.  I was doing my fitness 7 days a week without days off for 60 straight days and I was barely ever sore from one day to the next. "

I was thinking about getting fusion brand but it's expensive for 1.9lbs of protien. Any advice is appreciated.",
    "answer": "I like Clean Simple Eats protein powders and Vital Protein‚Äôs Unflavored Collagen. The guidelines my nutritionist gave me for picking a protein powders were this: for animal based protein: whey protein isolate tends to be the most easily absorbed and tends to cause the least amount of digestive issues for plan based protein: pea protein powder tends to be the best a good protein powder should be 150-180 calories, 25-30 g of protein, with less than 5 grams of carbs per protein collagen is a helpful supplement for protein but since it‚Äôs missing one amino acid, it shouldn‚Äôt be a primary protein source As long as your protein powder follows those guidelines, it just comes down to taste, which is personal preference. My recommendation- DO NOT STOCK UP ON PROTEIN POWDER BEFORE SURGERY. Tastes change after surgery. Protein powders you like beforehand you may not like after. So have a couple of samples or small sizes on hand to try once you‚Äôre cleared but don‚Äôt buy any large quantities until after your surgery and you know what you like.

My mother received the sleeve when she was 38 after having 2 grown children.

My question is am I too young and if so then when will it ever be the right time?",
    "answer": "‚Ä¢ The best thing to do is to call your insurance company and ask them. If you‚Äôve been working with a bariatric clinic, I would have assumed that they would have already confirmed coverage with your insurance company. So you may also want to call the bariatric clinic and confirm with them. When you talk to your insurance company, tell them: ‚ÄúI want to confirm eligibility for bariatric surgery.‚Äù After you talk with someone, make sure they send you a written summary of coverage that confirms how much of the surgery would be covered and what the criteria are. When you talk to your bariatric clinic, ask to speak to their billing specialist or insurance coordinator. You want to know what pre-authorization they have received from your insurance company. This is also a good time to ask them what the authorization process will look like. You can also ask to be copied on all communication with your insurance company so that you can see what is being submitted. Edit to add: the billing specialist at your bariatric clinic will also be able to give you an estimate, based off your insurance, how much you‚Äôre likely going to need to pay out of pocket. "

    "question": "Hi all, I‚Äôm seeing my doc for follow up but wanted to see if anyone else has this experience after any laparoscopic surgery.\n \n I had my VSG back in Nov 2023. No complications. All went smoothly.\n \n 2.5 weeks ago I went to the ER and ended up having to have my gallbladder removed through emergency surgery. Same surgeon that did my VSG did the gallbladder removal. And he went through 4 of my original incisions. Both surgeries were robotic.\n \n Since the surgery I‚Äôve had a numb patch of skin (about the size of my palm) under one of the incisions, the one he pulled the gallbladder from. They said this can be normal, from a nerve being cut during surgery and could take a couple of months to ‚Äúheal‚Äù (might not though).\n \n All of my pain was getting better, but then at the 2 week mark, the abdominal pain near the same incision where I have that numb patch had been having sharp pains whenever I bend or cough. Feels like a Charlie horse/muscle spasm. It was so bad I went back to the ER because I was afraid I ripped something inside.\n \n CT is completely normal. Bloodwork is beautiful.\n \n Has anyone else experienced anything like this?

    "answer": "If you are unwilling to do a bypass then you shouldn‚Äôt consider a VSG. The most common side effect of VSG is acid reflux/GERD, affecting 15-30% of all patients.

So the chances of needing a bypass are low, but not 0.  Euphoric-Light9764 Yeah. At that point the equation is different. Ideally I'd just redo my ESG or find meds that work.

I discharged from the hospital yesterday afternoon and I've been managing my water, meds, walking and using my incentive spirometer. I woke up 2 times last night with spasm pain so I took some meds and went back to sleep. I woke up again just now and the spasms are quite painful. I'm starting to wonder if this is hunger pains??? I've literally only had water day of surgery, and the entire day afterwards. My doctor gave me a blue raspberry isopure (clear protein drink w/ 32 oz of protein) that I've taken maybe 2 sips from.\n \n Would it be recommended to start \"eating again\"? The doctor and hospital staff did say I can go back to full liquid diet today. Or is this just spasms making me confused lol. I don't particularly feel hunger other than this pain if that makes sense üòµ‚Äçüí´üòÖ\n \n Also another quick question, did any post-opers experience a ton of flem that needed coughed up or is stuck in their throat/nose? My provider didn't mention it and I've spent a lot of time coughing up gross face boogers etc. Hurts my abdomen to cough but without coughing and getting this shit up I feel like I can't breathe.\n \n P.s. I have a message out to my provider for these questions as well, I just like having the public opinion as well",
    "answer": "Congrats on getting your surgery. It‚Äôs not hunger. You won‚Äôt feel hunger the for at least the first month. What some people confuse for hunger are: stomach pangs from surgery (probably those spasms you‚Äôre talking about), acid reflux, dehydration, and head hunger. But as crazy as it sounds- your body right now isn‚Äôt hungry. Now, if you‚Äôve been cleared for full liquids, go ahead and try some protein shakes if you want. Obviously, the priority this first week post-op is hydration. But if you‚Äôre meeting your hydration goals, go ahead and introduce some protein shakes into your diet. Remember to treat the protein shakes (or soups, or thinned yogurt) as meals- follow the 30/30 rule and keep the meals to no longer than 30 minutes. A lot of people get themselves into trouble when they move to full liquids because they spend hours nursing a protein shakes and don‚Äôt give themselves enough time to hit their hydration goals.

First night was ROUGH... but been settling down since.\n \n I'm in Phase Two - had some questions for those who've been there.\n \n Besides protein shakes, water, cream of wheat/oatmeal, sugar free popsicles, what did y'all consume during this phase? My wife made some split pea soup that's helped the cause. Did you eat other \"cream of\" or broth based soups that filled you up? Did you make them yourselves or buy a specific brand?\n \n What kept you feeling less hungry? I know I've got less stomach than I did a week ago - but still feeling unsatiated.\n \n Thanks!",

Still trying to figure out when to eat went to stop drinking. Went to take my vitamins all that stuff.\n \n Anyhow, about 20 minutes ago, I started to feel real dizzy. I think I may be dehydrated any quick at home remedies?",
    "answer": "‚Ä¢ You may actually be water logged but too low on electrolytes and potassium.  If you like pickles, try eating a pickle or two or sipping some pickle juice. If not, liquid IV, Gatorade, Powerade are all electrolytes, and some banana for potassium or a supplement if you have it.  Electrolytes are  NOT talked about enough but if they get too low, digestion shuts down, you get symptoms of light headedness, dizziness, headaches, heart palpitations or beating fast or skipping, out of breath easily, nausea.  It is why before surgery they test for this and if too low they will actually CANCEL surgery, it can stop your heart.  When you are working so hard on drinking water, you can be hydrated but the balance of fluid to electrolytes is way WAY off.  So try this.  If it is this, pickles should have you feeling better in 10 to 20 minutes.  It takes a very short amount of time for the electrolytes to start balancing. If not, other things it can be is low iron, low protein, low blood sugar, yes dehydration but it seems like you drank quite a bit in the morning?  How much had you eaten in the day?  Did you exercise?  Did you get enough sleep?  There are many factors to take into to consideration to figure out what may have caused it  ca77ywumpus Start with the electrolytes, or something salty, like pickle juice or broth. Sodium and potassium are important because they tell your muscles when to contract. (this controls heartbeat, breathing, blood pressure, and gut function!) If that doesn't set you right, check your blood pressure and have a small snack of fruit or juice and some protein. If you're still feeling off, call your doctor.  "

Luckily I‚Äôve been blessed with incredible insurance that is literally covering everything, but now that the date is set I‚Äôm very nervous.

    "answer": "Nerves are normal and you don‚Äôt need to get over them. You don‚Äôt get over it- you just do it nervous. After all- you do things that make you nervous all the time. It doesn‚Äôt mean you aren‚Äôt also excited or ready for this. It just means this is a big change. You‚Äôre nervous because the date makes it real. It‚Äôs not some hypothetical ‚Äúone day‚Äù. It‚Äôs a real day 3 months away. Focus on why you‚Äôre doing this. Focus on facts. And if the nerves get too bad- get off social media. Social media, and support groups like this sub are great but also can disproportionately show the negative outcomes- because those are the people most likely to look for support. So if you get too freaked out, take that as a sign to unplug.  Tlatif Thanks for the advice, and yeah I think you‚Äôre right, the date being on the calendar made it real.  "

I am actually on a 2nd round of antibiotics.\n \n Anyone else ever have spotty gym attendance and NOT beat themselves up?",

    "question": "Ive been binging on ranier cherries..im obsessed with them!",
    "answer": "Cherries are an excellent source of antioxidants, vitamin C, potassium, and fiber. They are also high in carbohydrates, with 25 grams of carbs in just 1 cup of cherries and 20 grams of sugar. In general, ‚Äúbinging‚Äù any kind of food is not healthy behavior. Eating should be an intentional act, not something you do mindlessly. ‚ÄúSnacking‚Äù between meals is discouraged for gastric sleeve patients since this behavior can lead to grazing, and grazing is the number one cause for weight regain. (This can be confusing since a lot of gastric sleeve patients will eat 4 or 5 small ‚Äúmeals‚Äù throughout the day, and one or two of those meals may be referred to as a snack. This is not the type of snacking I am talking about.) But cherries can be an excellent addition to any meal. I would recommend pairing the cherries with some sort of protein to help round out the meal and keep you fuller longer (like some Greek yogurt, or a couple cubes of cheese). If you routinely eat a meal that‚Äôs entirely cherries every day it may make it difficult to hit your protein goals. And eating only cherries could leave you feeling hungry sooner than eating cherries paired with some protein.  Decent_Ad8295 Okay thank you sm! Im still trying to find ways to eat smaller meals! I usually drink a smoothie instead of eating!     snarkyBtch Maybe you could throw a handful of them into greek yogurt, plain or vanilla.

    "answer": "Hey! 7kg is good! It obviously depends on your starting weight but mind you, if you can‚Äôt do sport, loosing way more would mean loosing a lot of muscles! I lost 9 kg in about the same time but I‚Äôm struggling to meet my protein goals so I know I am not loosing only fat. Are you tracking your deficit? I don‚Äôt want to do it for life but I‚Äôm doing it in the first months just to have an idea of what I‚Äôm eating and how much it represents. No information is 100% accurate but I eat about 500 calories a day, spend about 2700 calories and so I‚Äôm in a 2200 calories deficit which means more or less 300 grams per day. In any case, better taking things slow, it‚Äôs way better for your body and gives it more time to heal!! Hope that helps!  Shyivee Thank you! I will start counting my calories, I‚Äôve never done it before but it is important! Thank you     "

    "title": "Eating \"Regular\" Foods Post Op",
    "question": "Hi! I'm in the process now of getting the gastric sleeve. I'm only 2 appointments in and my psychiatric appointment is in a few weeks. I think this is the right choice, but the more I learn the more overwhelmed I get. I don't want to give up carbonated beverages and pasta forever. I want to have those things in moderation. I don't want a life where I'm so limited. I've heard other people say that, once they recovered, they were able to have those things just fine in moderation, while other people said it just wasn't possible. What's your experience with this? Is this hesitation a sign that this isn't the right path for me? Obviously I want to be healthy but I don't want anything to be forbidden to me in life, that just doesn't seem like a happy way to live. Obviously this is a big life change so I hope you'll understand where I'm coming from. Any advice is appreciated!",
    "answer": "the hesitation is a sign that you're a human being that is scared of surgery. personally, I can have pasta and carbonated beverages just fine. i even drink from a straw! it just takes time and patience. some things may not seem like a happy way to live, but it's a hell of a lot better than being morbidly obese. these sacrifices are tiny in comparison to the reward, personally.  PhantomPeachh I'm just really afraid of spending the rest of my life obsessed with food. I did that for years and it led to restrictive behaviors that weren't healthy for me either. I want to make better choices, not have my life dictated by food. I don't want to care about numbers, I just want to eat smaller portions of healthier foods. And that's not possible the way I am now. I've tried doing it the natural way so many times. I don't care about my end weight as long as it's a weight where my cholesterol and blood sugar are lower. I don't want to be so obsessed with a food I can't have that I end up binging and dumping. I can abstain for as long as necessary to fully heal but eventually I do want to go back and have foods that I like in moderation. I guess the reality is that might not be a possibility if I go the surgical route and I have to determine if that risk is worth it for me personally.  5 more replies 5 more replies  "

    "question": "Anyone had acid reflux before the operation? My husband has a lot of acid reflux but he really wanted to do the operation, but the doctor said his reflux could be worse. I‚Äôve seen cases where they operate on the hiatus hernia at the same surgery and fix both problems at the same time. Anyone had this kind of reflux? How did it go after the surgery? Thanks",
    "answer": "It depends on what‚Äôs causing his acid reflux. If his acid reflux is caused by weight, then the VSG could help him. But if it has other causes, then the VSG is probably the wrong choice for him. He shouldn‚Äôt be making this decision on his own. He won‚Äôt know until he talks to the surgeon and gets some tests done. Part of the pre-op process is an EDG and barium swallow test. Both of these tests will help your surgeon understand what‚Äôs causing your husband‚Äôs reflux and they‚Äôll decide off those results if he‚Äôs a good candidate for surgery. "

    "question": "Hi all,\n \n Right now im 3 days post surgery... The first 16 hours were a bloody hell, now things have improved and I can deal with it. Fortunately for me, I had the operation at the same time as a pharyngitis I got in the operating room and my PMS, I think you can imagine how horrible it is.\n \n Have any of you ever lost your appetite completely? I don't know when my body is telling me that it hurts, that it is uncomfortable or that it wants liquids. If I see my family eating I feel sick, it is as if the food smells horribly bad, like rotten, and I have to go.\n \n My surgeon is a wonderful person who helps me with everything but I don't think he understands how crazy my body has become. The only thing I can stand is water and soups, they brought me a juice and just smelling it almost made me vomit, at least my body sends me signals of what it does not want me to take under any circumstances. On the other hand, I have no idea how much to take so I'm probably under taking, my surgeon tells me I can fit about 200ml in my stomach but since I don't know where my limit is yet I don't dare take more.\n \n I was 100% sure before the operation but right now I feel so confused with my body's signals that I keep wondering what the hell I've gotten myself into and if it's worth it. I know it is, it's just how I feel, like everything is upside down.",
    "answer": "How you feel the first week or even the first month is ZERO indication for how you‚Äôll feel later. Everything you feel right now is temporary- hunger cues, fullness cues, discomfort eating or drinking, desire to eat or drink, cravings- all of that is going to change. The first month is crazy. Believe me- your surgeon actually does understands how crazy things are for you right now. Because, and I say this with all the love- you aren‚Äôt special. What you‚Äôre feeling and experiencing isn‚Äôt unique. You can drink more than you realize. Fluids won‚Äôt damage your stomach. If you do drink too quickly you may experience some temporary esophageal spasms. If that does happen, all you need to do is wait a little bit (20 minutes) and then start drinking again at a slightly slower rate. Unless the water is coming back up- you aren‚Äôt drinking too quickly. But limiting your fluid intake because you‚Äôre afraid of drinking too much is one of the worst things you can do right now. How quickly you recover is directly proportional to how much you drink. Your body is desperate for fluids right now. And once more- everything you‚Äôre feeling right now is temporary. You just need to have some patience. It will get easier and better. But right now you just need to rough it out.  Gamuxino You are totally right. I didnt mean like my surgeon doesnt know, i mean he didnt feel it on first hand, he for sure knows all but doesnt know how it feels, even that, he is such a kind person. Im really happy with him, it just this sensation of being frustrated cause i dont understand my own bodyüò¢  "

Well i got down to 299 2 weeks PO (approx 23lbs down since surgery 11/26) and have been fluctuating since then. Today i stepped on the scale and was 303 ?? I know it‚Äôs normal to stall at this point because it‚Äôs typically water weight at the beginning but I am feeling so discouraged. im at the pur√©e stage and have no appetite until i am starving towards the end of the day. I typically eat around 300-400 calories overall, the most i‚Äôve had PO is about 600.

    "question": "Hi all!\n \n HW: 434lbs. CW: 282.8lbs. GW: 160-180lbs.\n \n About 5.5 years ago I had my first bariatric surgery which was a vertical gastric sleeve. 3 years later I had a SADI-S revision to help with further weight loss.\n \n My weight seems to fluctuate 5 lb or so, so it will go up 5 lb or I will lose 5 lb. I think it's kind of a plateau?\n \n My question is, how much should I be eating 5 years later? I mean what should my portion size be like?\n \n Currently I eat what I would say to be medium size portions. Far less than what I used to be able to eat prior to the surgery, but more than the first year after the gastric sleeve. I would estimate that maybe I'm eating somewhere between two and a half to three cups of food per meal, three times a day plus occasional snacks. I feel like maybe this is too much food? I read some articles, and they say that after surgery, portions should be around one cup?\n \n I admit also that my food habits are not the best, in terms of what I am eating. I am transitioning to a vegan diet, so I am relying on too much quick and ready-made foods (like french fries.) I know what I need to be eating, I'm just really not sure how much.\n \n What do you all think? What would be the ideal portion sizes for each meal? I'm also trying to become more active, but winter is here in Finland and it is quite dangerous to even walk outside because of the ice sheets. I am thinking about getting a membership to the local gym and swim hall though to start exercising there instead. I had a membership during my first surgery, and I was so in shape and able to do so much.\n \n If you read this far, thank you! Any advice is appreciated. ",

    "answer": "Will you be able to build muscle? While you‚Äôre losing weight, no. Muscle gain and weight loss are contradictory metabolic processes, because weight loss requires a caloric deficit and muscle gain is basically impossible in a caloric deficit. Also, 10-20% of ANY weight loss, regardless of method, is going to be muscle loss. You also will not be able to workout for at least the first 4-6 weeks post op, and it will be probably 6 months before you are eating enough to support the high intensity, heavy impact workouts that are needed to build muscle. However, if you start working out when you can and you are diligent about meeting your hydration and protein goals, you can maintain a lot of the muscle you already have. And, once you are done losing weight and you‚Äôre no longer in a caloric deficit, you‚Äôll be able to focus on building muscle mass again. Will you be able to watch your kids during the first month post op? Yes, but you‚Äôre going to be very tired. Expect your energy to be SHIT the first month post op. You are recovering from MAJOR surgery. Your body is going to take some time to recover. Most people are able to go back to their daily responsibilities around 5-7 days post op, but it won‚Äôt be easy. Expect it to be hard. If you can get more support, get it. Whatever you can love off your plate, move it off. You‚Äôre energy starts coming back around weeks 4-5 and most people find that by week 6 they have more energy than they did pre-op. But that first month is HARD.  Amareallyama Exactly what I needed to know. I‚Äôm so grateful and I have more realistic expectations now  "

I just had lunch‚Äîtwo eggs‚Äîim on blended diet and I didn‚Äôt finish my food. I started feeling bloated, and a few minutes later, I began vomiting. With phlegm. Has anyone else experienced this? Should i be worried?",
    "answer": "You may have eaten too much or too quickly. Happens to the best of us and I‚Äôm over a year out. Two thing I simply can‚Äôt tolerate is smoked salmon or coconut milk. I dump so hard with that. Try again with egg in a few weeks if your head lets you I am also a very sicky sleeve patient  MrsMalak Yes will try again for egg in a few week time! Thank you for your advise!   "

    "title": "Went To Hospital For A Bypass, Came Out With A Sleeve",
    "question": "As the title says, I was scheduled for a gastric bypass surgery. That was what I had prepped for and what I was mentally prepared for. However when I woke up, the surgeon told me that due to unexpected complications during the operation, they had to switch to a sleeve instead so that was what they did on me. I was aware that this could happen as I had given them permission to do so when I went in for the consultation a while back. I thought it would be better to do something if the alternative was just closing me back up without doing anything at all.\n \n I'll admit that even though I knew that technically it was a possibility, I had not really prepared for it to happen. So when the surgeon told me after I woke up from my anesthesia that I had gotten a sleeve instead of the bypass I had initially prepared for, I was rather disappointed and had some conflicting feelings. On one hand I'm glad they were able to do some surgery on me at all and that I didn't go through all of this for nothing. But on the other hand I am terrified that I will fail or not lose enough.\n \n I have been told by so many people that people who get the sleeve lose weight but then gain it back up again that I just started believing it myself. Just about everyone said that the bypass would be the more foolproof option. But thanks to this sub I see that it is possible to lose the weight and actually keep it off.\n \n For now I am just trying to learn as much about the sleeve as possible and trying to get used to my new reality, even if it was not the one that I thought would happen. Have any of you experienced anything like this before? Or do you have any encouraging words? I would truly appreciate it üíñ",
    "answer": "Neither is foolproof and no doctor in his right mind would fudge the surgery without good reason. I'd inquire into why they had to swap. Remember also, the sleeve can be converted to the bypass later if you have issues. And both have weight regain chances - I personally know people with both that are huge now but it's their fault. The success is really up to you. With malabsorption with the bypass, I'd rather the sleeve. We discussed it prior to surgery and that's what I went with. Slightly over 2 months from my surgery and over 50 lbs lighter PLUS incredible new habits and I'm happy with my sleeve. Still good to know why they had to swap, just in case of any health issues you should be aware of. But you still have amazing chances at self improvement with the sleeve.  craftysunshines You are absolutely right, no doctor would do that on purpose and I have no doubt that my doctor did what he thought was absolutely necessary. He actually prefers doing bypasses, so I don't think he made the swap for any other reason than it being medically necessary. Looking at my surgery notes, it looks like there was an issue with my abdominal wall being too rigid and near impossible to move in a safe way. English is not our primary language here so I'm just doing a rough translation ü´£ I am glad for the chances of complications and dumping being less, though. The more I read about it, the more positive I am getting, despite the initial disappointment. Congratulations on your loss! I am so happy to hear that you are doing well, and I hope to be able to be in the same place as you in a few months time üíñ       "

Now my work place is a little wishy washy, and my boss has clear favourites and I'm one of them so I knew if I asked if I could use a sick day,, he would let me have it.\n \n The thing about my boss is he's not very open minded and made a lot of pretty crappy comments to my co worker after her surgery. So I went to his office to ask for the day of personal leave and all I said was I'm having surgery and would be recovering. He essentially made the assumption, and I didn't say yes or no to what the surgery was for. He gave me a huge lecture, asked if I tried everything, that I should try Ozempic blah blah blah. I ended up crying and leaving his office.\n \n Fast forward to today, I was having kfc, I had left my lunch at home by accident and KFC was the closest and cheapest place nearby. He came into the office and saw me eating it and walked over and asked if I needed to be lectured, why am I having that etc etc.\n \n Now that he's commenting on everything I eat, I don't even feel comfortable eating at work. I'm trying to hold out till after my surgery to find a new job. But what do I do in the meantime? Maybe I just need some words of encouragement to get me through?\n \n Please note I cannot go to HR, his wife is HR and I don't feel comfortable going to her.",

Nobody has experienced both the sleeve and the bypass for their first bariatric surgery. My conclusion from what I have seen being shared online is that the recovery process is similar for both and that the question of gas or incision pain is so individual that it is not a factor of the type of surgery.  dracos99 I second this.

    "question": "I'm going to get my date from the surgical schedulers this week, but I received a call today from my surgeon. He wanted to touch base with some of his colleagues about whether a sleeve would be appropriate, given that my endoscopy found some minor, non-precancerous Barrett's Esophagus. He has determined that I can do a sleeve (rather than a bypass), which I'm very happy about, but he also received strong advice to put me on omeprazole, so he is prescribing that. Apparently it will be long term or permanent, and as I did a little research online, it sounds like omeprazole isn't intended to be used long term. Maybe that's different for sleeved folks? Has anyone had experience with this?",
    "answer": "Omeprazole long term is not unreasonable. In your scenario, it sounds like a good plan. The main reasons I don‚Äôt like to give long term omeprazole is because it is often given without deterring the cause of reflux or indigestion (which can be a sinister cause) and because it slightly increases osteoporosis risk. It‚Äôs all about risk vs benefit. There are some minor risks to long term PPI use, such as a slight increase in risk of bone fracture and some minor electrolyte imbalances. For you the benefits would be two fold - you would be reducing your oesophageal cancer risk significantly, and you would be losing a lot of weight which will help with your general life expectancy and lower your GI cancer risk. If you were my patient, I would strongly argue in favour of you going on a life long (or at least very long term) PPI. You will need regular endoscopy to monitor your Barrett‚Äôs(idk how it works in your country but here it would be between 6 monthly to every 5 years depending on how the cells look. Engaging with this monitoring is crucially important.  Dr_Nick_Literski Thank you for this!

    "question": "I was sleeved on 11/26 and for some reason, every evening I feel nauseous. Initially I switched from whey protein to plant protein to see if that helps, and it did a little bit. Every morning I have my plant shake around 8, no problem. Then Oikos pro yogurt at lunch, at 1, along with unsweetened applesauce and maybe refried beans. Around 6pm (sometimes earlier) I'll have another plant shake and it always makes me nauseous. I have Zofran but if I used it every night, I'd be through my prescription already. Has anyone else had a problem like this? Much appreciated!",
    "answer": "There is absolutely no reason why you should be rationing Zofran. If you run out, just tell your surgeon and they will call you another prescription. We‚Äôre talking about nausea medication, not narcotics. You can always get more. So use it every night for as long as you need to. Now- as to why you‚Äôre nauseous. First let‚Äôs look at your hydration, since dehydration is the number one cause for nausea post op. When you get to 6 pm how much have you had to drink (NOT including protein shakes- we‚Äôre looking at clear liquids only)? If you‚Äôre not drinking enough throughout the day, dehydration might be what‚Äôs making you nauseous. Second thing- it could be that the gap between lunch and dinner is too long. A yogurt and applesauce or refried beans is a nice big lunch, but what if you did the yogurt at 1, be applesauce/beans at 3:30, and then the protein shake at 6:30? Spreading your eating out more might help things. Third- what are you doing before dinner? Are you following the 30/30 rule? When you‚Äôre drinking your shake are you sitting down, focusing on your meal, or are you multitasking? How long does it take you to finish the shake? It could be that you‚Äôre drinking the shake too quickly or you aren‚Äôt giving yourself enough time between when you stop drinking clear fluids and start drinking the shake. It could also just be a weird, random thing. Maybe try doing something else for dinner. "

I just don‚Äôt want to irreparably ruin my life, I‚Äôm already not doing the greatest mentally or re physically. My husband seems to be healing well, but he also seems tired to me. :( Although he does work a LOT too, doubles/overnights. So I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôs most of the reason. Anyway, yeah, thank you all.",
    "answer": "Of course your husband is tired. He just had major surgery. Forget how little he‚Äôs eating- his body is expending an enormous amount of energy to heal itself. Not to mention it takes 6 weeks for the effects of anesthesia to leave your system. His energy will come back. For most people this starts to happen around 4 weeks post op but it can take up to 3 months. The sooner you‚Äôre meeting your hydration and protein goals every single day, the sooner you start feeling better. And then once the energy starts coming back it keeps coming back until you have more energy than you did post op. That‚Äôs because as you lose weight your body has more energy, despite eating a fraction of what you used to eat. So no- the reason your husband feels like shit isn‚Äôt because of what he‚Äôs eating or because he‚Äôs working a lot (although lack of sleep certainly isn‚Äôt helping). It‚Äôs because his body has suffered major trauma and he‚Äôs healing.  Flimsy-Resist8171 I hope he pulls through all the way and then some! He‚Äôs excited about tomorrow because he gets to start soft foods.  "

    "title": "I Am Scared...",
    "question": "Hello! Let me be honest: right from the start, I am scared of this surgery. I am worried about what the lifestyle change might mean to me, and I went down the negative post-op posts within this community on the symptoms. I know it comes down to leaping forward, but yeah...\n \n I'm a male in my late thirties who weighs about 335 pounds. I start my pre-op diet tomorrow, and my surgery is set for the end of this month. The pre-op diet doesn't worry me at all as I see it as meal planning and moderation, which I've done before my wedding.\n \n I've read and re-read the phases of the post-surgery breakdown, and what scares me is this question: \"Is this how it's going to be for the rest of my life? Can I not eat starches again? Can I not eat my country's cuisine anymore? Will it always be 4 to 6 ounces of lean meat, a cup of vegetables, and a serving of fruit or yogurt?\"\n \n I don't have any vices. I only drink alcohol (whiskey & IPAs), no drugs. Would I not be able to drink again? (I am a social drinker; I don't even drink alcohol with my meals in general, but I occasionally hang out with friends either locally or via traveling). I drink to enjoy what I am drinking, not to blackout.\n \n I am probably just rambling questions that all or none have had in mind, as I have noticed right now. Still, the only person I knew who had this surgery passed away due to an unfortunate accident, so I have no one to turn to, and I know the doctors and nurses are going to give a plain vanilla answer. I will say that my friend looked terrific and happy, but I also didn't see the struggles he went through post-op, as we lived reasonably far from each other, so these questions and concerns cannot be answered by someone I trusted when I at the cusp of this journey.\n \n People react differently, heal differently, and approach this from all perspectives and reasons. I need to understand if it's going to be worth it, and to do that, I need to hear the brief success stories but also the bad ones for balance.\n \n Thank you for sharing in advance, and I completely understand if this post is not for you.\n \n Update: I just want to thank EVERYONE who chimed in on my post. Thank you for the words of encouragement, words of advice, and pushing the change in mindset and perspective. Seriously, thank you all and this has pushed me forward to doing the surgery.",
    "answer": "The pre-op diet doesn't worry me at all as I see it as meal planning and moderation, which I've done before my wedding. If this doesn't bother you, there's no way the long-term diet should bother you. Is this how it's going to be for the rest of my life? If you follow your team's plan then yes, this is how it's going to be for the rest of your life - and lucky you! For the rest of your life you'll be healthier, have more energy, be more fit, be able to do things you can't or won't do now, you'll feel better, you'll get off of many if not all of your medications for high blood pressure, diabetes, etc. It's the whole point of going through with the surgery. See what I did? I focused on the positives instead of the negatives - try working on your mindset. Would I not be able to drink again? I stopped drinking completely, simply because it's not worth the risk of becoming addicted (this is actually a thing with WLS patients), and it does absolutely nothing positive for your weight loss or your health. If it's really that important to keep drinking, I don't know that anyone will stop you, but I go out with friends all the time; they drink, I don't. It's never been an issue. I need to understand if it's going to be worth it YES. Read that again - YES. If you follow your team's plan, it will be MORE than worth it. I weighed 571 pounds when I started this process three years ago; yesterday I weighed 237 lbs. It has not only completely transformed my life, it's given me my life back. Do it. Make the most of it.  colossus1975 Thank you for the reply and a big congrats on the weight loss! That is incredible! Yes, I know the mindset is the biggest hurdle and I'm sure I'll get there but knowing its two weeks away all of a sudden hit me. Thank you for the encouraging words.  "

    "answer": "Nothing helps but time. Gastric sleeve creates weight loss that exceeds the skins ability to firm up. Eventually, your weight loss will stop and your skin will catch up as much as it can. There are a lot of snake oil salesmen out there claiming this or that cream will fix saggy skin. They are lying. All of them. Your skins ability to shrink back up is dependent on a few factors 1) Luck of the draw genetics 2) How overweight you were. 3) How long you were overweight.  3) The age you lost the weight. 4) How well you took care of your skin both before and while you were overweight. Once the damage to the collagen and skin structure is done, it's done. No amount of cream or injections will fix it. Building muscle under the skin will lessen its appearance, but doesn't fix the skin. Skin removal surgery removes excess sag, but doesn't repair the damaged skin. The only way to fix your skin is a time machine. Go back in time and make your younger self not gain weight, lose the weight sooner, and use lotion more often. It sucks, but it's the truth. Best case scenario, anyone telling you that a cream worked for them probably had some of the above factors in their favor and would have firmed up regardless of what they used. Worst case scenario, they're lying to sell you something. That being said, lotion is good. Everyone should moisturize regardless of skin elasticity and age. Also, use sunscreen everyday. Sun damage makes saggy skin look worse, it also makes skin saggier. "

    "question": "I had surgery 05/07 and I‚Äôve only lost 40lbs. I‚Äôm starting to become discouraged. How can I kick my body back into losing weight. Sleeve",
    "answer": "Track everything you eat. Measure with a kitchen scale and measuring cups- don‚Äôt eyeball. Every bite, every snack- track it. Tracking does two important things. First, it brings awareness to how much you‚Äôre actually eating and what your habits are. Second, it allows you to take a critical view of your nutrition- are you getting enough protein? Where are the bulk of your calories coming from? Are you eating enough at meals or binging at night? Set up an appointment with your nutritionist and your surgeon. Your weight loss team is here to help you. So many people shoot themselves in the foot by not reaching out to their support system because they‚Äôre afraid their surgeon is ‚Äúgoing to be mad‚Äù. The surgeon and nutritionist want you to be successful, they will only judge you if you don‚Äôt reach out and end up gaining back what you‚Äôve lost. Celebrate what you have accomplished. 40 pounds may not be what you were hoping to lose, but it‚Äôs still incredible. Your health is still improving and your body is better thanks to the work that has already happened. Too often during slow weight loss people spiral. Instead of looking at what they have accomplished, they focus on what they still haven‚Äôt achieved and they can end up self sabotaging. Don‚Äôt fall into this trap. Those 40 pounds are amazing, don‚Äôt you dare let yourself give up now and lose them because this process isn‚Äôt looking the way you thought it would. Weight loss is a journey, where you need to find what works for you. There is no time limit. If you aren‚Äôt happy with the results up to this point, then that means you need to be doing something different. Track your food and reach out to your medical team to come up with a plan for what you‚Äôre going to change. "

That was my weekend workout, and sometimes more often if I traveled to other locations. Through the summer, I exercised at least a walk each day. In early October, I began early morning workouts on YouTube most days. In early November, asked a friend who‚Äôs the Zumba instructor and a personal trainer if she thought I would be able to do some other classes. She said absolutely and reminded me that I can always modify if needed, but that I was strong enough to do any of them. First tried MX4. Then I gave Body Pump (HIIT with weights) a shot. I discovered I LOVE all classes choreographed. Now I do Sprint classes, too (spin). I‚Äôve just reincorporated rest days as I started swelling from over exertion. As soon as I took a rest day and focused on my liquids, my most recent plateau broke. I just felt ready to add things each time. And they often followed a plateau‚ÄîI‚Äôve had tons of those. I‚Äôm not as far as others who were at my starting weight and I often feel quite discouraged by that, but I met every one of my surgeon‚Äôs goals for me, have been meeting my protein (was 60, now 80) and calorie (was 600, now 800) goals. With my increased workouts, my nutritionist thought I was plateauing because of too few calories. I often workout 500-700 calories a day, according to the Baritastic app. Do what feels good, and then push yourself to do a little more. Remember your Why. When you‚Äôre exhausted, when you‚Äôre fatigued during a workout, when you think you can‚Äôt take another step at that pace, remember why you‚Äôre doing it. You‚Äôve got this! "

I often read most of the posts in this group and I'm posting for the first time.\n \n My current stats: 41F. CW 370. Height 5'6 on my best day.\n \n I'm meeting with my PCP for final consent and the EGD is scheduled for 1/10/25. Assuming everything looks okay with those 2 appointments, I'll move on to final insurance approval. Looking/hoping to have the procedure in March.\n \n For those that are closer to my stats, how was the procedure for you? What was your weight loss like? How is the extra skin? The surgeon said he would like me to finish out between 180-200lbs. Where did you finally settle and how long did it take you? Any complications?

    "answer": "Crystal light is amazing! Mio, true lime, and liquid IV are also great options. I‚Äôm also a big fan of the Gatorade Zero packets.

The second day my goal was 5,000. And then I upped my goal by 1,000 every day until I hit 10,000, which remained my daily goal for the rest of my first month post op (and is still my goal on days I don‚Äôt work out). If you‚Äôre someone who walked a lot pre-op, I think that‚Äôs a good place to start. If you weren‚Äôt, my suggestion would be that today, don‚Äôt focus so much on steps but just getting up and moving every 60-90 minutes while you‚Äôre awake. Maybe try for two longer walks (10 minutes). See how many steps that is at the end of the day. Then try to increase that by 500 steps each day. "

When I get out of my bed I black out for a moment. And I‚Äôve started up in the gym which I‚Äôm enjoying so much aside from the dizzy spells. I had my surgery abroad and stayed near the surgeons office for 9 days before coming back home, they‚Äôve stopped asking about me after the first week back home. I got no psychological help nor any education in nutrition just sent off with some multivitamins compression socks and Panadol for pain I don‚Äôt know what to do at this point the internet if full of information but every opinion is different.",
    "answer": "Ok. Big breaths. You‚Äôre likely dizzy because you‚Äôre dehydrated. You need to make hitting at least 64 ounces of fluids a day your number one priority. That means it‚Äôs more important than protein, more important than steps, it‚Äôs your number one goal. And if you‚Äôre working out, you need to be closer to 80 ounces a day, if not more. At 26 days post op you should be able to hit that mark. It may be hard, but there is no reason why you shouldn‚Äôt, and if you can‚Äôt you need to go to the hospital ASAP. You need to be drinking CONSTANTLY throughout the day. Unless it‚Äôs 30 minutes before or after a meal, you should be sipping on something. Use clear water bottles so you can clearly see how much you‚Äôre drinking and break your hydration up into mini goals (like 16 ounces by 10 am, another 16 by 2pm, another 16 by 6pm, and then the final 16 before bed). Treat protein shakes as meals- not hydration. This means you drink them at specific meal times, not sipping on them throughout the day (that‚Äôs a really good way to miss your protein goal and hydration goal for the day.) Follow the 30/30 rule- no drinking 30 minutes before and after the meal, and the meal lasts no longer than 30 minutes. That may mean you only get part of the shake. That‚Äôs fine. After 30 minutes you‚Äôre done. I was advised by my nutritionist to do 4 small meals a day spread out every 4 hours and that works really well for me. I suggest you start there and see how that feels. If you feel like you can eat more at meal times, try going down to 3 meals a day. If you can‚Äôt eat enough in 30 minutes to meet your goals, try 5 meals a day. IT IS WAY TOO EARLY FOR YOU TO BE AT THE GYM!!! What are you thinking? You‚Äôre not eating enough to support your body through a workout. You absolutely should not be working out. There is no way a surgeon would have cleared you for working out at this point. If you‚Äôre looking for movement- walk. You can workout AFTER you‚Äôre consistently hitting your protein and hydration goals. But you are going to fuck up your metabolism and tank your recovery by working out before your body is ready. "

He really should be avoiding starchy carbs and wanting them isn‚Äôt a reason to have them. This is kind of a tough concept to take, because the brain will argue about ‚Äújust a little bit to stop the craving‚Äù‚Ä¶ but it‚Äôs not so much about the pasta itself. It‚Äôs craving a return to normalcy and the way things were Before. It‚Äôs trying to plug a hole in the ocean and the experience will never match the memory. His perception of flavors and textures has changed. It‚Äôs pretty typical for everything to taste horribly sweet, including tomato sauce‚Ä¶ but the classic ricotta bake (no noodle lasagne in muffin cups) is a solid option.    "

    "answer": "All whey protein powders curdle at high temperatures (roughly 140 degrees Fahrenheit). It's a function of whey protein's structure -- there are chemical bonds that are broken when it gets too warm. I personally just waited for things to cool down before putting whey protein in them. Collagen generally does fine with heat (it's the protein in broth, after all) but it's not a complete protein.

    "answer": "You need to take your pills with food. Also, you should ease back into taking meds. That was way too much all at once, especially on an empty stomach. Hold off on the vitamins for now. Vitamin deficiencies take months to develop. So a couple more days without your vitamins isn‚Äôt going to do a damn bit of difference. Get used to taking your normal meds again. AND WITH FOOD. On full liquids that means protein drinks or broth.  Then slowly start adding in your vitamins. Treat your protein shakes like your meals. That means follow the 30/30 rule, no drinking 30 minutes before and after the meal, and the meal should last no longer than 30 minutes. Drink as much protein drinks as you can in those 30 minutes. If that‚Äôs 3 sips, that‚Äôs 3 sips. It‚Äôs fine. Protein deficiency also takes several weeks to develop. A lot of programs have their patients on clear liquids for the first week post op.

The most common comment I got was that it gets better and I will find new ways to cope. Now the rational part of my brain knew all of this was true. But the ravenous part of me? The addicted to food part of me? It ignored it. I had to go through this and experience it. So I did.\n \n I had two slices of pizza (the cheese only) and a little bit of bread. OMG. I don‚Äôt have the bypass but I think I experienced dumping syndrome.\n \n It felt like there was a rock in my stomach. I had pain. I had nausea. I nearly threw up but I took zofran. My heart was racing. I was terrified my stomach was going to burst open.\n \n And you know what the craziest part of it was? It wasn‚Äôt any of that.\n \n The pizza didn‚Äôt even taste that good.\n \n I have no idea how the brain works but I applaud it for being able to convince me that I am missing out on the finest elixir known to man. I was watching pizza mukbangs. My mouth was watering thinking about that perfect slice.\n \n It wasn‚Äôt even that good. Certainly not how I remembered it. Certainly not how I expected it to be.\n \n So on top of the pain and the new taste buds, I had a change of heart and a big lesson learned.\n \n I am really thankful now for this surgery. I think I just needed to go through a period of mourning and withdrawal.\n \n Yeah, I sound like a coke-head, but that‚Äôs what it was like for me.\n \n Anyway, I hope this helps anyone who is currently regretting their decision. If you still are after reading this, just know you‚Äôll have to live through some consequences to see any change. That‚Äôs just part of life.\n \n A kid won‚Äôt stop saying ‚ÄúNO!‚Äù to wearing a helmet and riding a bike until he falls and scrapes his body all over and realizes how great helmets are.\n \n The same applies to us still desperately in love with food and our old lives.\n \n TL;DR- was regretting surgery and craving pizza, had the pizza, got dumping and pizza didn‚Äôt taste good, now i‚Äôm fine.",

I'm personally interested on how the post op lifestyle changes have impacted others executive function abilities, but other more broad parts of the experience would be great to learn too. I already know the rough size and shape of how it'll go, since my dad got it a few years ago, but I want to hear from a wider range of experiences",
    "answer": "Yo! Was sleeved almost 3 weeks ago so I won't be able to give you a huge feedback but I can talk about a few thing I've noticed. Hospital time was fine, no issues adjusting for me, despite all the noises and anxiety. I had to stop my adhd meds for a few days starting surgery days because they feared my increased heartbeat would cause issues during the procedure + could not swallow anything not liquid for 3/4 days. I got bad insomnia for the 2/3 days I started them again, I think a mix of all the medicines in my body. I actually lowered my dose a bit because I could NOT reach my eating goals the second week because my appetite went from 10% to 0% lol I know I have storage but having basic calories in my body is also necessary for healing from surgery. On food, it's been actually quite hard navigating through the stages. First 10 days of full liquid, I got so bored out of my mind of drinking broth that I actually went for thicker soup and drinkable yogurt. My body took it well. But now that I'm on pureed stage, I am actually not interested in eating anything except mashed potatoes. So I'm half of the time still on my drinkable yogurt shakes and it's been quite repetitive. I get enough calories and almost proteins so it's fine but it might not be good for the sake of re-introduce some food progressively. I had to FORCE myself to stay still the first week after surgery. I have very low pain and fatigue awareness so I was up and walking 10K steps 2 days after I got out. My parents and therapist told me to calm down but eventually I was so tired the next week that I stopped. Now I alternate between days where I do NOTHING and days where I need to be active otherwise I loose my mind. I have crazy purchases impulses from imagining my goal weight and wanting to buy so many clothes. I might also have made google sheet ALGORITHM to predict my weight loss according to different parameters as well as a guide to understand pant sizes conversion with crazy color and way too many details. The autism is hyperfixating on the idea my weight loss only so I have a lot of issues focusing on working on my skills to get a job (I work in animation) or do stuff I'm supposed to do. All my special interests are on pause, my brain is a little obsessed by what my life might look like in april and I'm quite overstimulated from it. I'm listing the bad stuff but I've been doing pretty well, my weight has been mostly the result for bad hormones + difficulties with food due to adhd and autism which always created bad dysmorphia for me so I just feel like I'm becoming myself now after years of masking cause I felt like my body enveloppe was another person and I couldn't exist as long as \"we were co-living\".

From what I saw on here, some people are allowed to get puree straight after surgery. So as long as you are SAFE, you are fine. Now I'm personally more worried on the consequences this has on you, the regret, the shame, being afraid. You know you got this surgery not only to loose pounds but to get a boost to finally heal your relationship with food. Healing is also about letting go of the \"restrictive diet or you are a failure\" mentality. You're gonna cheat more than once during this journey and it should not be considered \"cheating\" in the first place. There is no valid reason some people get to eat whatever they want in life without ever feeling guilty about it. The important things to ask yourself now are: - did this make me feel in danger/sick? - did eating this potato salad satisfied how you were feeling or was it disappointing in the end? - is there something more in line with your current phase that will satisfy an urgent craving? idk like a delicious juice or \"milkshake\" ?

    "question": "Hey I have surgery in 5 days. Today I went to my pcp for the pre-screening and I so happened to wake up with a sore throat. Long story short I asked for a strep test and it came positive. She assured me I should be fine and the surgery office did too. Now I'm on amoxicillin 500. Anyone else have the bad luck before the big day?",
    "answer": "This isn‚Äôt bad luck. Bad luck would have been finding out you had strep the day before. This is incredibly good luck. Think of how much it would have sucked if your pcp appointment had been a few days earlier. You might have not realized you have strep until 3 days before the surgery which would not have been enough time on the antibiotics and the surgery would have needed to be canceled. The antibiotics should kick this thing in the next 48 hours. You‚Äôll be feeling brand new by the time you go into surgery.  Current_Round455 You make a great point. Thanks!  "

But it‚Äôs still there. Any advice how to relieve some of this pain?",
    "answer": "Gas X won‚Äôt do shit- because it‚Äôs not that kind of gas. The gas isn‚Äôt in your digestive tract, it‚Äôs in your abdominal cavity. The good news- the laws of thermodynamics are on your side here and the gas will leave in the next 24 hours. The more you move the faster that will go. You will still have incision pain- which might be what you‚Äôre feeling now (pain the your abs, swelling in the lower abdomen, cramping). The best thing for that will be liquid Tylenol (extra strength is best). Take that as often as you can following the dosing instructions. Have someone help you stand up and sit down for the next couple of days. And keep walking- sitting still for too long will do more harm than good. Don‚Äôt worry about the protein shake. Right now your number one priority is hydration. Once you are hitting your hydration goal, then try to drink some protein. You should be drinking ALL OF THE TIME. Literally, as long as you‚Äôre awake there should be a drink within arms reach from you that you are drinking. Set alarms of your phone to remind you to take a drink. In a couple of days when you do start drinking protein drinks, treat them like meals- no drinking 30 minutes before and after and the meal should last no longer than 30 minutes. That may mean you only get 3 sips of protein shake. That‚Äôs fine. You‚Äôll get more as you get further out. "

    "question": "67 year old male, 5'11\", good health, but going crazy! I got my sleeve 12 years ago and lost 160lbs, from high of 370 got down to 210 in about 18 months. It wasn't easy, but in hind sight, it was a lot easier than it is now. Other than not being able to eat anything but very small amounts at any one time, I really didn't want or need to over eat - for about 5 years. If my weight creeped up, I could easily cut back and the weight would instantly fall back off. After 5 years, I still couldn't eat large amounts, but my cravings went crazy - essentially back to the way it was before my sleeve. Now I am constantly craving, I snack all the time, and I can eat much larger portions, although still smaller portions than before sleeve. My weight is creeping up - I have gained about 40 lbs. I wake up every morning pledging that I am going to be disciplined, but then I fall off the wagon every day. I have no self control. And even when I do get discipline, the weight won't move. It stops going up, but no matter what, no matter how little I eat, it won't go down. I have even fasted for 2 days, and then gone on 800 cal/day \"diets\" for weeks and nothing! Weight won't move. I am so freaking frustrated and depressed. I am back to being the obese person all over again. I want to go on the Ozembic type drugs, but insurance won't cover and they are FAR too expensive. I don't know what to do. I so don't want to gain all my weight back - but I just don't know what is going on or what I can do to stop this cycle. I still exercise, walk 5 miles a day. I gave up alcohol. I feel like i have no pleasure in my life when I am back to fighting food again all the time. My life with food feels like what an alcoholic must feel like with alcohol - I try to be disciplined and eat properly, but then I eat a snack, then another and then another. Like an alcoholic saying he will just have one drink and then ends up blacked out! Does anyone's life look like this? Has anyone ever found a way out of this evil cycle? Looking for any words of encouragement, please!",
    "answer": "Maybe you can talk with your doctor about a gastric bypass, these are for a lifetime..  f1957 I was opposed to the bypass way back when I chose the sleeve. The whole concept of malabsorption was the main reason.  I don‚Äôt think I would want to entertain that‚Ä¶. Thx  "

    "title": "Full Vs Satisfied",
    "question": "I always see people say eat until satisfied, not full. What is the actual difference? What does feeling satisfied after eating feel like?",
    "answer": "Satisfied means I no longer feel hungry and I‚Äôve enjoyed what I‚Äôve eaten so far. I feel good, and I also know that I‚Äôve eaten enough. Full means that my body has started to send some signals that my stomach is starting to run out of room- for me that‚Äôs normally burping or a runny nose. If I eat past that point, or I‚Äôm eating too quickly to get those signals, the next sensation is an uncomfortable fullness in my upper abdomen. I feel heavy, and maybe even a little cramping. If I eat past that point (or, and this happened more often early post op when I was still learning how to eat) I‚Äôm eating too quickly to notice those signals, then I get pain, and possibly nausea, which could result in throwing up. Satisfied is an emotional and mental trigger that the meal is over. Fullness is a physical trigger that it‚Äôs time to stop eating. Ideally, you‚Äôll feel satisfied around the time you start feeling those first early fullness cues. But as you get further post op and your stomach‚Äôs capacity has reached its final point, you may reach satisfied before you get any fullness cues, and that‚Äôs a good sign to stop anyway. You don‚Äôt need to eat until your stomach tells you to stop.  Ok_Yogurt7975 Thankyou. This is helpful (I‚Äôm 8 weeks PO and still figuring these things out)  "

    "answer": "So I was advised to avoid heavy lifting for the first 6-8 weeks post op due to the risk of developing a hernia. Although recovery for most sleeve patients is relatively smooth, it‚Äôs easy to forget we‚Äôve had major abdominal surgery and therefore we need to take things easy in the beginning. If you haven‚Äôt already, I‚Äôd consider telling your professor that you‚Äôve had major surgery over the holidays and won‚Äôt be able to lift heavy weights until cleared by your surgeon. Another thing to bear in mind is that, although you‚Äôll be mobile early on, you‚Äôll be pretty tired and have reduced energy levels. This is because your body is healing from a major trauma and you‚Äôll be on a significantly lower caloric intake. So it may take you a while to get back up to speed.

    "question": "Got mine scheduled for the 16th! Would anyone share some advice? ( day before, morning of, what to take to hospital, etc..) I would appreciate any and all feedback!",
    "answer": "You don‚Äôt need much at the hospital- phone, wallet, change of clothes, extra long charging cable. I also recommend an eye mask for sleeping and a robe to wear when you walk around although neither of those are necessary. The sooner you start drinking and moving around, the better everything will be. Drinking at first may feel weird, uncomfortable, or maybe even a little painful. You still need to drink. Take comically small sip- almost like you‚Äôre pretending to sip and some liquid escaped past your lips. Drinking will get easier over time and you can start taking bigger sips, but start off small. Your surgeon will likely give you a goal of drinking one ounce every 10 minutes for the first full day post op. The sooner you‚Äôre hitting that goal, the better. But you‚Äôll need to push yourself. Set alarms on your phone as reminders. Walking will also help. For the first several hours after surgery you‚Äôll still be pretty groggy and sleepy, so you may only be able to stand up and take a few steps. But the first full day post op, once you‚Äôre up, try to take a little walk every 60-90 minutes. Keep walking throughout your recovery. Remember, the first couple of days will be the worst, but it will get better. Most people are feeling mostly normal by 5-14 days. But be patient with yourself. Your energy will also be really low for about the first month post op. That‚Äôs also normal and ok. It will come back. Typically by 6 weeks people feel like they have more energy than they‚Äôve ever had. But before you get to that good part you have to push through the hard part. So when things get hard (you‚Äôre dealing with pain, or struggling to hit your goals) be kind to yourself and remember- this isn‚Äôt forever, it‚Äôs just for now. "

    "answer": "My surgeon said \"I never want to be one of those 'never take this kind of doctors' but there are risk associated with taking NSAIDS after surgery.\" He likes to approach it on a case by case basis. His opinion is that, once healed, NSAIDS can be taken as needed, short term, with precautions as long as you are not having other issues. So, as a sleeved patient, if I remain GERD free or GERD controlled, and healed, and find that Tylenol is not cutting what I am dealing with, I can take a normal OTC dose of an NSAID with food and preferably with a proton pump inhibitor like Omeprazole. I have also heard from others that NSAIDs are less of an issue for Sleeved patients as our pouch is larger than a bypass pouch. But, since it is still smaller than a stomach, it is important to take them with food and possibly with a PPI for extra insurance. "

My bloodwork is all done, I'm starting therapy next week, and I would be right on track to having this surgery approved and scheduled if not for my gastroenterologist not signing off on the surgery on their end. I am going to be having a colonoscopy later this month, per their request, and may be switching my ulcerative colitis meds, then may require another colonoscopy to check that the new meds are working. It just feels like a giant roadblock and I'm not sure how much of a setback this will be. Months? A year or more? My bariatric surgeon's office told me that I have a year from my initial visit to have the surgery, I'm just so ready for this and I've worked so hard to get to this point and it's hard not to be discouraged, especially not knowing how long it will take to get my GI things sorted out. How have y'all handled any setbacks in the approval process? It makes me want to just give up on even trying, though I know that's my disappointment talking.

Being too passive is a good way to end up with things not getting done in a timely manner. You need to call your gastroenterologist and get a clear picture of the next steps moving forward. If there are potential future follow up appointments, see if you can get those scheduled now (they can always be cancelled if they aren‚Äôt needed). When you go in for your colonoscopy, explain to the gastroenterologist what your timing restraints are. Keep communication open with your surgeon as well. Yes, there‚Äôs an element of patience here. Your gastroenterologist obviously can‚Äôt give you any clear answers until they know more. But that doesn‚Äôt mean they can‚Äôt explain what the next steps would look like and you can start working on contingency plans now. "

I‚Äôve been overweight my whole life, but recently it‚Äôs really starting to take a toll on me, so I‚Äôve talked to my doctor about getting the sleeve. I talked to a surgeon, did the program, saw a nutritionist, and did the counseling. I‚Äôve lost 14 pounds so far, and my final appointment is on December 16th before I get scheduled for surgery.\n \n I really want to do this, but I‚Äôm terrified of losing my hair. I know it sounds silly considering all the health benefits of losing the weight, but to me, my hair is the only thing I‚Äôve ever liked about myself, and the thought of losing it makes me feel like I‚Äôll have nothing left to love about myself.

However I am feeling really confused and lost.\n \n After my final nutrition appointment, I told my mom (who has struggled with her weight for years and has finally lost about 60lbs and looks amazing for it) that I was excited to be done with classes and moving on to the waiting process for approval. Well she revealed that she is not exactly excited for me. She thinks VSG is too drastic and wants me to try other things first- like the GLP injections. Unfortunately my insurance (specifically my work) won‚Äôt cover them so I‚Äôd be paying totally OOP, which is money I just don‚Äôt have. My mom did offer to help me pay for them if I consider it. She also suggested I join something like WW and see if it doesn‚Äôt help me with food habits.\n \n Well I of course was upset so I went to my husband for comfort, only to find out he is glad my mom said something because he also doesn‚Äôt want me to do it. He also said he thinks it‚Äôs too drastic and thinks I should try meal prepping and exercise again- with his assistance (he‚Äôs a chef so he said he‚Äôd help me plan and cook meals). We were supposed to sit down last night and discuss the plans he had come up with for me- and all he said (after I had to drag it out of him) was to eat high protein, no more than 1000 calories, and do yoga 3x a week. That‚Äôs all great advice- but not what he promised me and not really what I need in this timeframe.\n \n I went from being so excited about the idea of finally taking my life and health back to being utterly decimated that my two people I rely on most for support- don‚Äôt agree with it.\n \n My biggest problem is I have tried diet and exercise, for almost a year I counted calories and macros and did jiu jitsu 3x a week and nothing changed- the scale, my measurements, my mental health- nothing. I have tried intermittent fasting, I have tried keto, high protein, even diet pills‚Ä¶. And I might loose a few lbs, but then almost immediately the weight comes back- and then some.\n \n I just don‚Äôt know where to go from here. I almost feel like my husband isn‚Äôt taking me seriously with this, and my mom is my mom and just worried.\n \n I don‚Äôt even know what I‚Äôm asking for here‚Ä¶.

    "question": "It‚Äôs a lot of weight to lose in 1 year, most people said they lost 80-100lbs. Did you feel like you were starving or was it quite easy once you found other activities to replace the time spent eating?",
    "answer": "So the surgery removes the part of the stomach that produces ghrelin (the hunger hormone) so for the first 6-12 months post op, your hunger is significantly reduced. After 6-12 months, your body will find other ways to make ghrelin (my dietician said it can also be produced by your intestines) so you‚Äôll start to get hungrier the further into recovery you go.  I‚Äôm 7.5 months post op and have lost 118lbs so far. I have three small meals a day and I don‚Äôt get hungry in between, unless I eat slightly later than usual. When I do get hungry, my stomach rumbles but that‚Äôs it.  Also it‚Äôs worth mentioning that usually when I think I feel hungry, I‚Äôm in fact thirsty so it‚Äôs always worth trying a drink first.

Any tips/tricks/strategies as I enter this new phase?\n \n I was sleeved in June, with a HW 291, SW 211, CW 143. Height 5'4\", 43F. While I've certainly taken on a more trim appearance (who knew I had a collarbone, let alone two?), I still have pockets of fat and flesh that need toning, as well as heavy legs (I'm a pear). I need to add resistance training, but haven't yet started. While I'm fully aware it's important, I was greatly worried about injury stopping my progress and also prioritized other exercise due to time constraints (like my daily walk to and from work, which is over 1.5 hours of activity total. It's tough to fit more in). According to the ASMBS calculator, I'm beyond the target (average) weight loss for my height/starting weight. I've also noticed that even though I'm eating more calories than I did a couple of months ago, my weight loss is still pretty consistent (slow, but steady in the downward direction). I next meet with my surgical team in late January.\n \n Thanks for sharing your thoughts and experience!",

    "title": "Adhd Meds And Insomnia Post Op Help!",
    "question": "Feels like the title sums it up! But there need to be a timeline other wise it‚Äôs never gonna be comprehensible.\n \n Short version: Struggling with insomnia 2 weeks post op due to either tramadol (painkiller), tramadol withdrawal, concerta + tramadol mix or just concerta on a smaller stomach? Melatonin won‚Äôt work anymore despite always working with adhd meds.\n \n For context, was diagnosed as an adult with adhd at 23 and started taking concerta at 36mg then 54mg. Honestly it changed my life, I have no addiction cause I can literally stop for a whole summer or a weekend with little to no effect. I always had trouble sleeping in the past (even before starting my meds) but my psychiatrist recommended me melatonin to help me sleep with concerta and it worked perfectly.\n \n However, my anesthetist recommended me I stop them (concerta) when I‚Äôm in the hospital and a few days after because swallowing was already super hard anyways and it can make my heart beat slightly higher. At the hospital, I was given a little morphine at first for pain, then switched to paracetamol and after I got out, I was prescribed paracetamol or tramadol for intense pain but was advised to not take too much tramadol.\n \n I‚Äôm usually not very sensitive to pain but the paracetamol pills are HUGE compared to the tramadol one so instead of taking 3xParacetamol I could not swallow, I would take just one tramadol before sleeping cause this is when I had the most pain anyways (took tramadol for about 4 ou 5 days?)\n \n But then, six days out the hospital, I took 36mg of concerta in the morning, and a tramadol at night and oh boy it was the weirdest day/night of my life. Could not eat, hyper fixated all day long on coding a google sheet (I don‚Äôt even do coding ever!), my day was full of timeskip (it was 3pm then 9pm in five minutes) and I had a full insomnia where I didn‚Äôt even struggle to sleep, I was just awake the whole time and it felt like 20 minutes.\n \n My guess is that tramadol somehow canceled my adhd and so I basically lived what non adhd people get when they take our meds lol and it was awful.\n \n Anyways, I didn‚Äôt take concerta on the following day but tramadol for one more night and I slept fine. Then I took neither the following two days and slept well but yesterday I was back at taking 36mg of concerta hoping the tramadol was out of my system. My day was normal (driven but no timeskip and I could eat) but I‚Äôm back at insomnia. So I‚Äôm confused on wether it‚Äôs tramadol + concerta or just concerta but I wanna sleep so bad. Apparently tramadol has hardcore withdrawal and that might explain but I wonder if eventually I can go back to my 36-54mg concerta + melatonin and be a normal person.\n \n If you are taking methylphenidate (concerta, ritaline, vyance, etc), how did it work for you post-op? Weeks later? I will talk about this to my psychiatrist later today but it‚Äôs the middle of my insomnia and I guess I‚Äôm bored and desperate haha üòÖ\n \n Thank you for reading, it was quite long I‚Äôm sorry!",
    "answer": "Hello! Fellow addy hadder, late diagnosed at 44. I‚Äôm on Vyvance and dex. I have not had issues with my Vyvance but have with Effexor XR. I went through withdrawals and have had to up my dose since surgery. I know Vyvance is long acting but it released in your blood. From memory, Concerta is different. So it could be that you are absorbing differently. You won‚Äôt get an addiction from tramodol from using it for that many days. But you may want to switch to Panadol and cut the tablets in half so you can swallow them. I would say this is likely caused from the massive shakeup you have had. There are massive changes to your tummy and also to your tummy. Surgery in general is unsettling. I would say you just need time and your Concerta during the day and melatonin will work again. Sometimes even being off our ADHD meds can also disregulate us and it can take some time to settle again. Just give it some time and all will come back to normal :)  lexblch thank you for your input! I swear my ¬´ non adhder on concerta ¬ª day was absolutely awful and I am worried about how my body can heal from surgery with so little food AND sleep üò≠  7 more replies 7 more replies  "

My weight was always fluctuating‚Äîsometimes I‚Äôd drop below 200 pounds through dieting, but I‚Äôd eventually gain it back. Then COVID hit, and I gained even more weight. I‚Äôve always been fascinated by bodybuilding and dieting, but despite all the knowledge I gained, I still struggled with binge eating.\n \n My mom had suggested I get gastric sleeve surgery to help with my weight loss, and while I initially declined, I eventually gave in.

Mentally, it‚Äôs been tough. I feel like I shouldn‚Äôt have gone through with the surgery; I altered my body to solve a problem I could‚Äôve handled myself by being more disciplined. I‚Äôve lost weight before without surgery, so why did I do this? Now, I feel like I made the worst decision of my life. It‚Äôs affecting me deeply‚Äîmentally and emotionally. I want to sculpt my body, but eating feels like a restriction now, and I wish there were a way to reverse this, but there isn‚Äôt. My stomach is permanently altered. I feel trapped like the only way out is ending myself.",
    "answer": "I know you‚Äôre having a hard time but I want present some facts. Obesity is a metabolic disease. Clinical trials have shown that obese people have less than 5% chance of losing and maintaining just 50% of their excess weight. The more we study obesity, the more it‚Äôs clear that obesity fucks up your metabolism. There‚Äôs a reason why you never could maintain your loss before and it wasn‚Äôt lack of discipline. You can ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù all day- but the facts are very clear on this. If you hadn‚Äôt gotten the surgery the odds are that you would be at a new high weight today. And that‚Äôs not a comment on your will power or dedication. Muscle gain doesn‚Äôt require excessive caloric surplus, you just need to not be in a calorie deficit. In order to maintain muscle you need to be consistently working out- and that matters more than your caloric intake. You went through a really hard time. Depression is a bitch and it makes doing basic self care tasks and even things you enjoy doing hard. Yes, eating enough is important, but if you‚Äôve also stopped working out that‚Äôs what‚Äôs to blame for the majority of your muscle loss. A common side effect of depression is appetite loss. I‚Äôm so sorry you‚Äôre feeling this way. Please take care of your mental health. Depression has a way of lying to you and making you feel like everything is hopeless. One of the bravest things you can do is keep existing, because even though it doesn‚Äôt feel like it now, there‚Äôs a future you who is so happy and grateful you pushed through. Good luck.  irish_taco_maiden ALL OF THIS! Excellent post  "

    "question": "Hi All!\n \n I'm 2.5 weeks post-op. Yesterday, I started the pureed food stage and had no issues until late last night when I had some cramping on the right side of my stomach (I attributed it to gas). At 3am. I woke up and had to run to the bathroom to vomit (nothing came up but clear fluid. I retched for over 10 minutes). Since then, I have had diarrhea and pretty constant vomiting.\n \n I'm throwing up clear liquid, some bile and anything I've tried to drink (water, water with crystal light, Gatorade zero, watered down Gatorade zero). I'm also just retching. It's been 14 hours.\n \n I have emailed the clinic but I got an out of office response as it's Sunday. I have an after hours contact number for my surgeon for \"serious concerns\" but I'm not sure if this qualifies.\n \n Would you wait until tomorrow or call? I don't want to be a bother or overreact. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è\n \n TIA",
    "answer": "Throwing up for 14 straight hours qualifies as ‚Äúserious concerns‚Äù!!!! Please call the number. Now  I want to elaborate- the fact that the vomiting didn‚Äôt start until 3 am indicates that this probably wasn‚Äôt caused by what you ate. That‚Äôs because pureed food is only in your stomach for 40-120 minutes. So by 3am dinner had long since left your stomach and your stomach had been empty for hours. If this was a more immediate response after eating it could be brushed off as just some food not sitting well, but it‚Äôs looking unlikely that‚Äôs the case which means something else is causing this- and list of something else is concerning, especially 2.5 weeks post op. The cramping on your right side is also very concerning. In addition- not being able to keep down clear liquids is super concerning because it means you‚Äôre actively becoming dehydrated. Even if this is just a random stomach bug- not drinking for over 14 hours means that you are approaching danger levels of dehydration and will soon need IV liquids.  4 more replies 4 more replies  "

It‚Äôs disheartening when I see people say they aren‚Äôt even able to eat 2 oz months after their surgery and I‚Äôm over here eating 4 oz barely a week post op.",
    "answer": "This sub is an amazing gift, filled with lots of support and advice- the one downside is that the nature of support groups will disproportionately show the most extreme outcomes and unconsciously favor the worst outcomes (because the people most likely to post, looking for comfort or advice, are those who are struggling.) The outcome of this is that people who are experiencing normal, healthy, ideal recoveries freak out because they think the extremes are norm. You‚Äôre fine. You‚Äôre better than fine. You are having a picture perfect recovery. This is what you want to happen. This is what should happen. Liquids sit in the stomach very differently than solids. Most patients don‚Äôt experience restriction until they are on full solids. The hunger you‚Äôre feeling now is normal, but it‚Äôs also not real hunger. It‚Äôs likely some combination of stomach aches from healing, maybe a little acid reflux, dehydration, and head hunger. If you feel hungry between meals, take it as a sign to drink more. It‚Äôs a good thing you can drink a lot, and the more you drink the better your long term recovery will be (the faster you‚Äôll heal, the the less stress your body is under, the less hair you‚Äôll lose, the more consistent your weight loss will be). YOU CANNOT DAMAGE YOUR STOMACH WITH LIQUIDS. If you do manage to drink too quickly, you may get this little esophageal spasm where the liquid may come back up, but as long as you‚Äôre drinking at a normal rate, that shouldn‚Äôt happen. If you‚Äôre drinking over 64 ounces (and if you can it‚Äôs great to drink over 64 ounces) make sure that at least 1/3 of that contains electrolytes.

I typically don‚Äôt freak out but I need some advice today please. Here‚Äôs the deal:\n \n I normally have less restriction a day or so before my period, which I attribute to hormones.

    "title": "Starting My Weight Loss Journey (With Bariatric Surgery Eventually)",
    "question": "Here's a little sharing of how I ended up making this decision:\n \n I (25M) have been severely obese, I guess, for at least half of my life so far. I also suffer from depression and anxiety which developed over the years due to bullying and lots of discrimination due to my weight. Some people can find motivation in it to lose weight but for me, binge eating has always been my coping mechanism from my mental health issues and obviously this only causes a downward spiral of being sad --> eating --> getting fatter --> being sadder...\n \n I crossed the 100kg (220lb) mark when I was 17, and with several major depressive episodes that happened within the past 7 years of my life, I end up hovering in the 150kg+ (330lb+) region this past year. That's when I decided to finally change. I mean I have attempted to lose weight so many times by brisk walking, dieting, but whenever I encountered some setbacks in life I would lose all motivation and turn to food. Hence I wasn't able to properly lose weight at all.\n \n Sometimes I think I'm using my mental health as an excuse for being obese and some people around me always asked \"why do I eat so much\". I always wanted to use my mental health issues to explain to them but I feel that they will think I'm just making up excuses so I just sheepishly laugh at them and move on to another topic of conversation.\n \n I read up on bariatric surgery just around 2 months ago and decided to just go for it. I am tired of being in a body that makes me physically and mentally drained all the time. It is admittedly a shortcut for me and sometimes I feel ashamed of telling people because they would think I'm just lazy to change and resort to surgery.\n \n But anyway, I started a weight management appointment with my local hospital late October. I've done my blood tests and nurse/doctor counselling, just went for my endocrinology appointment last Friday for further discussions on my weight management. I need to have 4 more appointments in other departments (physiotherapist, psychologist, surgeon and dietician), and I told my endocrinologist that I want to have my surgery in June next year (due to work-study schedule). He said he will help me to let the surgeons know and consider and started me on ozempic pills in the time being.\n \n I started my first dose yesterday morning and the meds are just making me feel extremely tired throughout the day, perhaps my body is still getting used to it. He says the meds will reduce my weight by 5-10% within the next 3-6 months and hopefully it really works. I will also beginning doing some brisk exercising to work along side with the pills.\n \n So my first half of 2025 will be filled with appointments with the various doctors but I just need myself to really stay motivated to lose some weight before the surgery.\n \n I joined this subreddit for support and some Q&As and I'm glad to see so many of your sucess stories, something that keeps me working towards the goal I want to acheive eventually. So hello to everyone here :)",

I justified a 20 oz diet dr pepper at the store because I've been doing wonderful on my diet and I thought it was a nice treat but now I'm feeling bad.\n \n I decided to pour the soda into a glass of ice to drink it slowly and enjoy it, about half is still in the bottle in the fridge.\n \n I thought the flavor was what I craved but it wasn't really what I ended up enjoying, it was the bubbles I enjoyed; but I noticed my mouth felt coated after my first sip and that was wild and offputting. I'm going to throw the rest of the bottle away I've decided.\n \n Did I fuck up my pre-op with this bad decision?\n \n Edit: Just after I posted this I dumped out the rest of the bottle and the rest of the glass of it with ice cause I realized it tasted gross tbh",
    "answer": "I just want to caution you about something.  Feel free to totally ignore it. I was in the same place as you many years ago and one day at work I said something similar (been doing good with food choices, wanted to reward myself) and my boss (a mental health and substance abuse counselor in recovery) said to me \"When I used to do that with heroin we called it relapse. You don't reward yourself for making good decisions by making a bad decision.\" It's something that has stuck with me for years and has helped in difficult situations.  Downtown-Narwhal1534 Dang.

    "title": "Diet Without The Cut Or Staple",
    "question": "Hello Gastric Sleeve Redditors!\n \n I‚Äôd like to get your perspective on something my doctor recently suggested. First, let me give you a little background:\n \n I‚Äôm 27 years old, 5'9\", and currently weigh 302 lbs. I‚Äôve been actively trying to lose weight for the past four years, but despite my efforts, I‚Äôve only gained weight. When I started, I was 285 lbs. I‚Äôve tried so many approaches‚ÄîPaleo, Keto, WW (formerly Weight Watchers), and likely others that I can‚Äôt recall right now‚Äîbut clearly, my methods haven‚Äôt been effective.\n \n When I mentioned to my doctor that I‚Äôm feeling hopeless, she reassured me that I‚Äôm not alone in this struggle. Despite my frustration, my blood work is still pretty good, which means my insurance won‚Äôt approve medications like Ozempic to assist with weight loss. Because of this, my doctor is exploring bariatric surgery options for me.\n \n During our discussion about bariatric surgery and portion control diets, my doctor asked me something that really caught me off guard: ‚ÄúWould you consider trying a diet as if you had already undergone gastric bypass surgery?‚Äù\n \n At first, I was surprised and a little unsure what to think. I haven‚Äôt done much research into bariatric surgery diets, but I do know a little from a friend‚Äôs mom who had gastric bypass and was incredibly successful with it.\n \n She once told me that one of the most challenging but effective parts of her journey was learning to stop eating when her smaller stomach told her to. She grew up in a ‚Äúclean your plate‚Äù household (like many of us) and had to fight those old instincts to avoid overeating. She said the uncomfortable feeling of fullness after surgery helped her reinforce new habits, but she also emphasized how much mindset played a role. She knew she could stretch her stomach out again if she didn‚Äôt stick to her plan, but she chose not to‚Äîand now, she says she‚Äôs never felt better.\n \n So now I‚Äôm wondering: What do you think of this concept? Could a mindset-first approach‚Äîwhere I eat, think, and act like I‚Äôve already had bariatric surgery‚Äîbe helpful for someone like me?\n \n I imagine it would involve small portions, eating very slowly, avoiding certain foods, and stopping at the first sign of fullness, which were all thing that my friend's mother described. It wouldn‚Äôt be easy without the physical restrictions of surgery to enforce it, but I wonder if it could be effective as a way to practice those habits.\n \n I‚Äôm just looking for perspectives and advice as I consider my next steps. If this question comes off as naive or offensive in any way, please let me know‚ÄîI truly mean no harm. Thank you all so much for sharing your experiences and wisdom.\n \n Looking forward to hearing your thoughts!",
    "answer": "This is called mindful eating or listening to your body‚Äôs satiety levels. Bariatric surgery is very very different form a diet. At the start, you literally cannot eat more than 100mls or you have pain, gas and extreme fullness. You cannot replicate that. Not trying to discourage you as I think learning about hunger and satiety puts you on a very good path. It‚Äôs just WLS is very different.  Technical-Eagle-1555 This is exactly what I was thinking when my doc had asked me! Although, to be perfectly honest, when I think of mindful eating, I don‚Äôt think of taking 5 to 6 bites of food a meal or some similar extremely small number. That‚Äôs why I wanted some different perspectives on this. Thank you!     "

I did one week of pre-op and am down a total of 6.7kg in under two weeks.\n \n I have a history of depression, anxiety and wasrecently diagnosed with ADHD. I have felt pretty low the last few days. I understand my body is going through the absolute ringer and this is normal - surgery, fatigue, low food uptake, hormone release. I am also becoming aware that I can no longer rely on food to eat my emotions. I have mild addictive tendencies in my past and have been working hard with my psychologist about it all of this.\n \n I‚Äôm also wondering about my medications, in particular the antidepressant and absorption? I am on Effexor XR - so a slow release. Effexor has a very short half life and is notorious for withdrawal effects if you are even late for a dose. My ADHD meds are working fine, as far as I can tell.\n \n Does anyone have any words of wisdom or experience with all of this, including antidepressants?",
    "answer": "The first month was rough for me, then it became smooth sailing for like the next six months. Then, it gets harder again. This was never meant to be a quick, simple fix. But, it's worth all the struggles, that I can promise you. Hang in there. You've got a great group of support here! I did find that going to therapy was a huge help. I started before I got the surgery, and I found a surgeon who is a bariatric patient herself. That's been a game changer.  Ok_Recognition_9063 Thank you for your words of reassurance. I was absolutely prepared for tough but I did not expect to feel low. But I also know the drill - find something to focus on. I‚Äôve been wanting to tame and shape a bonsai plant for forever. So, I‚Äôm going to get one today to start! Good wholesome fun! I found therapy to be great too. I started to see that food was just another way I have coped. I‚Äôve struggled the last few days with getting enough in. It hurts when it hits my new tummy - so I‚Äôm trialling different things. Thanks again, I know these feelings will change :)  "

    "title": "High Risk Candidate For Surgery In Mexico",
    "question": "So I have been debating getting bariatric surgery in Mexico. I have been working with OCC and they finally looked through my medical paperwork and approved me for surgery. But they said because of my health history (severe pancreatitis, sepsis, etc) they have deemed me ‚Äúhigh risk‚Äù. They said if the surgeons end up needing to cancel my surgery, I would only be refunded half of the money.\n \n All of this to say: should I go through with the surgery? I truly think I need it, and my weight is the reason I had the prior medical issues. Any advice would be helpful!",
    "answer": "Please, please, please do not go abroad if you‚Äôre high risk. You need to be closely monitored by your doctors and doctors outside the US have zero obligation to continue care after your surgery. I know it‚Äôs more expensive if you don‚Äôt have insurance for it, but you only have one life so please don‚Äôt play with it. I was cash pay in the US and paid considerably more, but the trade off was more than worth it for my peace of mind alone.  honeymeag Did you do cash pay in your home town or where did you go/ would you recommend that place?

    "title": "Change In Food Choices/Cravings?",
    "question": "Hi all, I got surgery 5 months ago and things have been going well so far. I've noticed it takes almost no effort for me to choose nutritionally dense food over poorer quality but really yummy food. I don't feel I need to end the day with a sweet treat anymore, I can say no to food, I can stop myself at one cookie, i dont use it to comfort me etc.\n \n Prior to surgery I had been working with my psychologist and dietician to help with my food issues for a couple of years, and i was able to stop binge eating. Still, I couldn't keep weight off long term, struggled to make good food choices, and thought about eating all the time.\n \n Now I'm just wondering if my change in eating habits is an effect of the surgery, and if so, will it wear off? After a year, 2 years, will I go back to craving \"bad\" food? Will I go back to thinking about food 24/7? I'm getting more and more anxious about it the further post op I go, I'm so scared to go back to the way I was before.\n \n Any insight of advice would be appreciated, thank you :)",
    "answer": "Idk because I‚Äôve gone through phases in my life where I eat healthy for several months to a year. Foods that don‚Äôt fuel me efficiently are not appealing during that time. I lose weight, I look great, I‚Äôm active. Then something happens that makes me emotional, and I want those foods that comfort me. I am only 6 weeks out now and I don‚Äôt think the sleeve could necessarily change the way we approach food. We are supposed to take the time after surgery making the right choices to for healthy habits. But there is nothing stopping us from breaking those habits when time gets tough. That‚Äôs why being honest with yourself is very important I suppose. Telling yourself when slip ups are turning into habits and effecting our lifestyle and goals. Having regular weigh ins once we have reached maintenance mode and when things start to climb up coming up with a plan to combat falling back into a pattern of destructive behavior.  For the first 5 weeks after surgery I had no appetite and zero problem following guidelines. Thanksgiving, I allowed myself to eat more. After that my digestive system basically awakened and said, ‚Äúwtf. Eat.‚Äù And now I feel ravenously hungry all day, every day. I have food thoughts that are very distracting. I want to eat everything I see, which is a problem because I‚Äôm a chef. Usually at work I am able to disconnect and not want food, but right now every dish looks appealing. It‚Äôs a big mess, but I am just forcing myself to go by the guidelines set by my dietician so I can make the most of the sleeve and hopefully this feeling will pass sooner rather than later.  6 more replies 6 more replies  Last-Walk3402 that's true, setting up good habits is the most important. it's hard, i feel like my habits rn are great, but I can't tell if that's from my own mind, my work with the psychologist and dietician or just only from the surgery. thank you! I'll have to I guess just try and make sure I stay consistent if the time comes when food choices aren't so easy anymore  "

    "question": "I am on pur√©e diet right now and I‚Äôm struggling with feeling full. Not full because I‚Äôm hungry. I‚Äôm not hungry. Any tips or advice?",
    "answer": "I am not sure if I fully understand how you are feeling but I can explain how I felt during that stage and where I am today. I got sleeved on 10/1 of this year and during my puree diet I became full quiet easily in the beginning but the feeling is different from today of true solid foods. I would say eat until you are neither hungry or hurting from food. Learn to eat slowly as this will prevent any pains. The best thing I can advise is to follow the diet best you can and you will find when you get to more solid foods you will start to feel the normal full and potentially hunger you are familiar with. If you are like me though even that was a new sensation as I never really ever felt \"Full\" before. Best of luck and try and enjoy your journey.  MrPres2024 I‚Äôm eating slowly. I guess it‚Äôs more I know I need to eat, I‚Äôm just not hungry. I‚Äôm eating small bites and slowly. I did stop once I felt ‚Äúfull‚Äù it‚Äôs just weird going from knowing hunger to not really eating for fun but for survival lol.

    "question": "*Despite the negatives listed, I would 100% still get this surgery; it is life-changing!\n \n \n \n BIG negative is losing muscle in the first few weeks when you can‚Äôt properly lift heavy weights. Before this, I used to go to the gym and lift heavy weights, but now the weight I can lift has halved. I‚Äôm a bit sad, but I know that I can easily rebuild muscle; I couldn‚Äôt easily get rid of my excess weight. I could do 100kgs on the leg press, but now it‚Äôs only 30kgs.\n \n \n \n Can‚Äôt eat spicy food - you can‚Äôt experiment with super spicy food since you can‚Äôt eat and drink at the same time.\n \n \n \n My stomach is vocal (it gurgles and ‚Äòburps‚Äô internally) - funny thing to laugh about with friends, embarrassing in front of strangers.\n \n \n \n Having to plan out when I eat and drink - have to watch the time.\n \n \n \n Dilemmia Example: I should drink right now because I‚Äôm so thirsty, but my only opportunity to eat is in 10 minutes. But if i do drink i will have to wait 30 minutes and i wont have enough time to eat. AND if i dont drink and wait to eat, that means: 10 mins waiting to eat + 10 mins eating + 30 mins waiting to drink means I won‚Äôt be able to drink for 50 mins.",
    "answer": "Yeah I think all of these are fair. I don‚Äôt really see them as negatives, just challenges. The strength thing is a punch to my ego, but I‚Äôm also running faster and longer than I ever could pre-op. My cardio has improved so much! The spicy food is also one I‚Äôve experienced, not because I can‚Äôt drink but I‚Äôve found that too much spice upsets my stomach. My surgeon says my tolerance will go back up, but in the meantime I‚Äôm having to stick to the milder end of the spice scale. As for the no drinking beforehand- my nutritionist told me that while the 30/30 rule is important (and I‚Äôve found that to be true), there is some wiggle room. If you‚Äôre super thirsty or need to take some pills, a sip or two of water isn‚Äôt going to mess things up, especially if you still have 10 minutes before you‚Äôre going to eat.  Faux_Potato You are so right about describing them as challenges, it really is all about perspective. I havent eaten very spicy food because i know my tolerance isnt the best and i know i'll need to drink afterwards so i havent experienced the upset stomach part about it. Ive still got so much to learn, thanks for your input and good luck!  "

    "answer": "I'm coming up on 3 years post op (in March). The final straw that pushed me into having surgery was a cold, hard truth from my cardiologist; it scared me into doing something now about my weight. I was a self-pay patient. I needed this to work, and I couldn't afford to pay for it and not have a long-term benefit from it. So I stuck to the plan; still do, for the most part. I weigh myself once a week, to keep myself on track. When my weight starts creeping up, a pound here or two pounds there, I remind myself to get back on the wagon and do what I've been doing.

I want to be healthy, and live long enough to see my grandchildren grow up.",
    "answer": "The way the doctor explained it to me is that while the sleeve does restrict your capacity to eat a lot, your body/hormones are adapting to this change, thus eliminating food noise and allow you to adopt a better lifestyle before your body is done adjusting (about a year) Now, how well the food noise is stopped varies from person to person, but it will come back. I'm 3 weeks post-op, and for the first time in my life, I have not thought about food, I haven't had a single craving. I walked past an entire aisle of Christmas candy and fast food places with no reaction. It's been wild. But, I've also been working with therapy to start changing habits and getting to the root of my disordered eating before surgery. Without the mental health aspect, a lot of people immediately slid back into old habits.  DELICIOUS_DANISH Yup, I'm a year post-op. As of this morning, I've lost 178lb. Only realized I had a sugar/carb dependency after I started the pre-op diet. Today, I average less than 25g of sugar a day, and I keep my carbs around 20% of my macros, which is about 80g a day. I still enjoy food. But instead of ordering pizza tomorrow night, I'm going to a nice restaurant for some lamb lollipops. The surgery will help you break bad habits and build healthy habits. But you have to be intentional about it. Make a plan for when you are going to start exercising. Find healthy, protein-rich foods you like. Soon enough, you will realize your old favorites just don't do it for you anymore.     "

I have a lot of back issues, heart complications, etc. And just got cleared for surgery(I'm waiting for the phone call to get scheduled). I lied everyone, because I knew what to say & what not to say. I still struggle with binge eating & eating junk food etc. I'm hoping that once I get surgery reality will set in, and I will take things very seriously. I want this surgery, not to look \"pretty & thin\" but for my health. I have so many health issues b/c I am so large. I just want to feel healthy again. Did anyone else \"lie\" and after the surgery had success with a healthy lifestyle? I know, I know... it's not good and it's not going to be easy once I have to surgery. It's a life style change...",
    "answer": "‚Ä¢ I was upfront about having binge eating disorder and still was approved for surgery. While it didn‚Äôt cure my binge eating disorder, it definitely made it a lot harder to binge. I still binge, it is just followed by pain and my binges are a lot less than what they used to be. A binge for me is eating an entire slice of pizza instead of half, then going for a second slice an hour later. But it‚Äôs still an emotional response to being triggered by something so I know it‚Äôs my BED. I genuinely feel like this surgery was the best solution to my BED because I physically can‚Äôt binge the way I used to anymore. I‚Äôll give you the same advice I was given about having BED and getting VSG: try not to stretch your stomach for two years. If you can make it two years without stretching your stomach, you will be set for life. Your stomach can still stretch after two years, but you will have lived for so long with such a different lifestyle, it will be hard to fall back into old habits. I still binged in those two years, but I used that advice in the back of my head to keep me grounded. 1/4 people fail this surgery. Don‚Äôt fail yourself.

    "answer": "Having gone through it (it was my first surgery of any kind), I can share with you that there's nothing to be scared of. Stick to your pre-op diet without exception. Do the same after surgery. The longer you can go without going off-script, the better you'll set yourself up for long-term success. Track everything - everything you eat, your water, your exercise, etc., and don't stop. Not in a year, not when you reach your goal weight, but never. Do it for life. It will help to hold you accountable to yourself, and if you ever find your weight starting to creep back up, you can always go back to your log to see what you're doing differently (it's easy to think your habits haven't drifted when in fact they have). Good luck to you!  ztrewqx Thank you. I‚Äôm currently tracking everything, and I‚Äôm surprised every time by how many unnecessary calories I used to consume. How was the pre-operative diet for you?

    "title": "Struggling To Eat Enough",
    "question": "Does anyone struggle eating enough times a day? I‚Äôm 4 weeks post op today and I‚Äôm starting to really struggle ensuring I‚Äôm eating 5 times a day. Because I‚Äôm not hungry I either forget or just cannot make myself make food to eat? If you struggle with this I‚Äôd love to know how you managed?",
    "answer": "set alarms on your phone- you can‚Äôt rely on your body to signal when it‚Äôs time to eat meal prep the night before. That sounds complicated, but it‚Äôs really not. Every evening I pack my lunch to take to work- that means a yogurt for breakfast, some leftovers from the night before for lunch, and a Fairlife shake for a snack. Basically, take just 5 minutes to set aside the food you‚Äôre going to eat the next day. That way, when your alarm goes off, you know exactly what you‚Äôre eating, there is no analysis paralysis. You just sit down and eat the food you‚Äôve already set aside. Follow the 30/30 rule religiously. No drinking 30 minutes before your meals and no drinking for 30 minutes after. In addition, meals should last no longer than 30 minutes. Every meal time, try to eat something, even if it‚Äôs just a few bites of food. It‚Äôs fine if that‚Äôs all you get. You‚Äôre still early on. You‚Äôll eat more as you get further out. But you have to retrain your body. Like any skill, that means practicing and doing what you need to do even if you don‚Äôt want to finally, see what happens if you go down to just 4 meals. That‚Äôs what I personally do, and it works really well for me. Part of this process is finding what works for you- and it may be that you do better eating less frequently. "

    "question": "Hi all,\n \n I was wondering what‚Äôs the recommended time to wait before trying for a baby after surgery?\n \n Or for you, how long did you wait etc?\n \n Thankyou ",
    "answer": "18-24 months is the standard recommended timeframe to wait. This is because the majority of your weight loss happens during those first 18-24 months and getting pregnant will stop your weight loss. So ideally you want to reach your goal weight before you get pregnant and maintain it for about 6 months. It could also be seriously unhealthy to get pregnant too soon if you can‚Äôt eat enough to support your body through pregnancy. "

    "answer": "Fat cells are mostly water, so when your body breaks down a fat cell for energy, what is left behind is mostly water. Your lymphatic system picks up that water and it joins all the rest of the water in your system. When your body has too much water, it will get rid of the excess, and your body loses water through your breath, tears, sweat, but mostly urine. So- it‚Äôs not until your body releases the water that you see the fat loss on the scale. When you are constantly dehydrated, your lymphatic system is deregulated and it will hold on to extra water. Remember also- you take in water two ways- what you drink but also what you eat. The thing is, when you were pre-op, you were eating a lot more. So now, post-op, you need to make up for the lost hydration in what you are no longer eating by drinking more. There are also a handful of additional reasons for why you need to drink so much more post-op, but suffice it to say, your argument of: ‚ÄúI was always bad at drinking before so the fact I don‚Äôt hit my hydration goals now shouldn‚Äôt be a problem‚Äù is a really pathetic excuse and (pardon the pun) doesn‚Äôt hold a drop of water. This surgery requires you to make serious lifestyle changes in order to be successful. Yes, those changes are hard. That doesn‚Äôt mean you can‚Äôt do them. Figure it out. You can do hard things. "

    "answer": "Yes I was scheduled for surgery in April of 2024. Two weeks before I started the preop diet and lost way more weight than I thought I could. After that I started finding all the reasons I could do it on my own but staying on a preop diet long term wasn't a good plan. At the time my family and friends was against me doing something so drastic to lose weight. My surgery was rescheduled until August 2024. I commented myself to the program, learned about all the possible risk that I might face, and locked down on the wonderful groups on here everyday. When August got here I was more than ready to make a change for myself and my health. My family and friends wasn't on board but in the end they realized it's the best thing I could have done for myself. The surgery gave me a new life and I'm currently down about 80 lbs from my preop weight. My advice is prepare yourself mentally and physically, and financially too with all the new clothing, vitamins, and protein shakes etc. If you have any doubts or fear that's normal it's a major surgery. What I do know is my health has improved and I'm happy that I prepared myself mentally first. In my opinion if I would have had the surgery in April and wasn't ready I don't know how successful I would have been. I've seen this surgery change so many people lives including mines. I can chase my preschooler around the house, I can go to the park and play with him and not get tired. I can go on for days about all the positives that has happened in my daily life. Just remember don't compare yourself to others this is your own journey and everyone is different. At the end of the day as long as you are healthier than you were it's a WIN!!! I wish you the best on whatever you decide.  Sad_Bake_9571 Thank you for this.  I do want the surgery but right now I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm 100% ready for it mentally.

Some people are exuberant about starting the final countdown but generally dropping into keto flu isn‚Äôt a good time for anyone. Your body is mad/feels crappy and you may be hangry af. Having a lot of different choices can help (rather than 3 vanilla shakes every day).

I have lost some weight that puts me under 40 bmi should I try to gain it back before Dec 10th",

It'll make you feel gross, bloated, and sick. I'm assuming you already have insurance approval and have multiple weights documented with your primary medicine and surgical team - so they KNOW your BMI was over 40. Personal journey: That said, at 5'4\", my HW is 291, and I was down to 222 at my last preop appt, and then 211 on the day of surgery. They were pleased with my progress, especially because the weight loss helped lower the risks of any operative complications. Plus, with the extensive workup and medical history, the surgical team knew I've lost weight (many times) before, but always regained ... so we knew my independent weight loss was going to need some help. :-) "

I felt strong and energized even the day after surgery. Today, I went back to work, feeling physically very good, but after just one normal work day at my 100% desk job (working from home even!)

    "answer": "I just transitioned from pur√©e to soft and found that I had to massively dial the portion sizes back. I was on pur√©e straight away post-op and on that diet was supposed to have 3-4 tbsp at any given eating moment but this gradually increased over the time, especially with more liquid food like soup. Then my first soft food attempt I ate way too much (although still very very tiny) and ended up horribly full for hours. No lasting damage but a wake up call! My dietitian advised me to go back to the tiny bowls I was using at the start of the pur√©ed stage as it was amazing how much more space the food took up. I have since found that fish doesn‚Äôt fill things up as much (have been having tinned tuna and salmon with light cream cheese) so I‚Äôm able to get more protein in than eating heavier meats, but I‚Äôve been carefully trying to tune into the moment that I need to stop eating (even if before the 15-20 min point I was told to follow) and I‚Äôve not yet had a repeat of the overstuffed feeling thankfully. Edit to add: as a result of these smaller portions, I did feel weaker at first because I was taking less in than before so I really went back to the drawing board and planned out timings to eat.

If I‚Äôm on the road and need to grab something, I get a protein shake from the convenience store. If there‚Äôs a McDonalds- then there‚Äôs a gas station that sells Fairlife or Muscle Milk. Finally- no sugar and added sugar is kept to the bare minimum. This is a big one. The thing that tends to make me feel most out of control is sugar. And when I get to that point I need to cut it out completely. The only sugar in my diet at that point comes from fruit, and fruit is kept to 1/2 cup max at meal times. These rules are strict, but being really strict with myself for a couple of weeks can help me kind of reset and get back into the correct mindset for weight loss. And these rules are simple to follow. There isn‚Äôt any grey area. Finally- fuck the mindset of ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to fail.‚Äù Seriously, every time you think ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to fail‚Äù I want to you say out loud ‚ÄúFuck that- failing isn‚Äôt an option. I can do this.‚Äù  I‚Äôm not joking. Your mindset is half the battle. Don‚Äôt let something as stupid as insecurity fuck this up for you. You‚Äôre not failing, it‚Äôs just hard right now. This isn‚Äôt a test, it‚Äôs your god damn life, and don‚Äôt you let anyone tell you, not even you, that you‚Äôre not good enough to make your goals happen.  akr11985 This is so good. Thank you so much. I was feeling really alone, like I‚Äôm the only one who has struggled after surgery.  Fuck that- I can do this! Getting strict starting now! Appreciate you!  "

    "question": "For context: F29, HW 286lbs, SW 262lbs, CW 176lbs.\n \n I had GS surgery in March 2024 and all went well. My surgeon examined me every day before he discharged me and was happy with my progress. 3 days post-op, I felt fine. I was discharged from the hospital in high spirits. I felt like I had made the best decision of my life, and was looking forward to the puree diet (my programme started it day 2).\n \n I severely underestimated how hard post-op would really be for me. On day 5, I went shopping, came home and started to feel sick. I was sickly for about 3 days (nausea). After that I broke out in hives as an allergic reaction to new meds I was taking and had a few sleepless nights. Early on, my chest felt tight and weird. I couldn't stand without my brain and head swimming. I struggled to focus. There were times I feared I'd made a mistake. I cried a lot. I woke up each day feeling dreadful and sad. I wondered if I'd ever feel strong and well again.\n \n To anyone who is struggling right now, please please please hold on and remember that you're not alone. I remember not being able to see the end, I remember thinking it'd be forever until I felt like myself again. TIME WILL HEAL THIS, I promise.\n \n I'm now 8 months post op, and I've lost just over 100lbs. I'm on vacation right now, and last week I was able to complete a 32 km run/walk. I can wear all my old clothes from before my kids were born. Yes I still struggle with body image but not anywhere near as bad as before.\n \n You've just had a major surgery. You need to rest and take care of yourself. You need support. Baby steps, you will get there.\n \n People will post about all the positives of WLS, especially once the memory of post-op struggle has faded with time. People will also say that they were fine after the surgery, didn't have any major issues and were back to work after a week.\n \n I want to emphasize for those pre-op, that recovery will look different for everyone, and there's no one size fits all approach. Please don't assume WLS will be easy. My advice is to make sure you know what you're getting into, make sure you have the right supports in place, and take adequate time to recover as you learn how to eat and drink again.\n \n My motto that got me through was, \"short-term pain for long-term gain.\"\n \n Time is your friend. One day, this will all be but a blip in the time continuum.",
    "answer": "I am currently 5 days post op and I feel this. I am having doubts and regrets because I cannot see the end goal yet. All I see is the struggle. Recovery is not easy and to actually lose the weight you still need to do the work of diet and exercise like you would normally do without the gastric sleeve. Now it's just forced into you because you literally cannot drink and eat more unless you want pain. Now I am just thinking that I will never be able to gulp an entire cup of water in one go and that's sad üòî because I like the feeling of satisfaction of a large cold glass of water. But I'm also thinking, without doing this to myself would I be able to commit to a proper lifestyle change which I tried numerous times before and failed. So I guess this is an extreme way of forcing myself to change since I just cannot do it without something this drastic. So yeah, the first stages of this life is such a struggle in all aspects, physically mentally and emotionally.  Acrobatic-Ad1871 5 to 7 days po I felt really depressed, its normal. I felt so much regret but it gets better. I still can not drink water or enjoy it without it hurting but it gets better day by day. Wish you the best!!    "

You will choose what‚Äôs best for you but I highly recommend it to anyone suffering obesity. To add, what really got me over the finish line was a surgeon who said that without medical intervention it is near impossible to maintain weight loss life long. You can lose it fine, (some people can‚Äôt even do that, I have PCOS and hypothyroidism) but maintaining natural weight loss is near impossible for those who‚Äôve crossed into obesity.

Different people struggle with different things, but there are some common threads. You will find support here for whatever problem you end up dealing with. Others have faced the same things and have come thru it. You will too. I also struggle with my relationship with food. I found help in therapy. You will have to find other things in your life to replace the comfort you get from eating and drinking. That's just part of it. You can do it!! You can still cook, btw, you just can't eat as much. I try to just find the \"perfect bite\" and eat that. Invest in lots of small freezer containers.  Raellissa I agree, get some 4-ounce freezer containers.  They make meal prep and tracking so much easier. And get a few deli or restaurant 2-ounce containers like they put hot sauce or yum yum sauce in. You can also get a lot of them cheaply, but I reuse them after washing them thoroughly. You can do this.  Mentally, try to find what causes you to eat. For me, one of the things while growing up was being told to eat food if it was offered even if I wasn't hungry because it would be rude not to. The surgery is a tool and you have to work on it to make it work, but it is doable. After a few months, it becomes instinctual to read labels, meal prep, and track your food. Remember, the restriction is on the quantity of food you can eat at once. You'll work up to being able to eat what you want in small quantities.  Don't be surprised if your taste buds change too.  "

    "question": "I‚Äôm only 6 weeks post op and feel like I‚Äôm going back to old habits.\n \n I‚Äôve been doing really good the majority of the past six weeks in terms of only consuming what my program guidelines allow, meeting my daily water and protein goals etc. But, the last 3 to 4 days I‚Äôm ashamed to say that I‚Äôve tested the waters with sweets, bread, chips and even a few sips of soda.\n \n I didn‚Äôt have any issues at all with the ‚Äúbad foods‚Äù I‚Äôve had over the last few days and even found that I can eat more than the 2oz of food I‚Äôm supposed to have as well.

I have been trying to lose weight since I was 18 and I am 21 5‚Äô3 now and my bmi is teetering at 40 at 234lbs and they said I will qualify still.\n \n I‚Äôm nervous about having a panic attack or not being hydrated enough and not getting enough protein or vitamins and randomly dying from neglecting my body.\n \n If everything goes well I hope all will be fine. I want to take better care of myself and see myself in a better light. I have no health issues at all and I am healthy despite being obese.\n \n I saw one lady called big Chris on TikTok that died from kidney failure by not following the rules strictly and many people kept commenting how they know people that died from bariatric surgery and it‚Äôs the only source I‚Äôve found that‚Äôs negative or dark about this surgery but it still is something that concerned me.\n \n Any advice or reassurances?",
    "answer": "I feel like I shouldn‚Äôt need to say this but I will anyway- TikTok, and comments on TikTok, are not reliable sources of information. Bariatric surgery is incredibly safe and has a very low rate of complication. This surgery has been around for decades, it is highly regulated in most countries, and the surgeons who perform it are incredibly skilled and knowledgeable. There are decades of research and the possible complications are very, very well understood. So we know exactly what a patient needs to do in order to avoid those complications. If you‚Äôre worried about how you‚Äôll do after the surgery I suggest doing the following things. Take your psych evaluation seriously. Be 100% honest with your psychologist about everything- your relationship with food and diets, your support system, your expectations for surgery. If your program or insurance doesn‚Äôt require a psych evaluation, get one any way. You need to know if you are in the right headspace for this surgery and if you aren‚Äôt, then it‚Äôs time to start working with a psychologist to get there. Start making the lifestyle changes NOW. Start drinking 80 ounces a day minimum. Start prioritizing protein, fruits, and vegetables at every single meal. Stop snacking between meals. Learn to meal prep and how to make healthy food so that you always have good choices. Start exercising, even if it‚Äôs just walking everyday. Move your body intentionally every single day. Take your nutrition classes seriously. Learn not only what you‚Äôre supposed to eat at every stage, but why. Learn what foods will fuel your body best. Again, if your program doesn‚Äôt do nutrition classes, find an outside nutritionist. Finally- make sure you‚Äôre doing this for the right reason. I just berated you about TT not being an actuate source of information, so I want to be clear- the following is a theory I have observed through posts on this sub, and is not backed by real data. But, it feels like younger people are more likely to get this surgery for the wrong reasons. Bariatric surgery is not an aesthetic surgery. Your primary motivation for getting this surgery shouldn‚Äôt be how your body looks. Yes, how your body looks will change. But that is secondary to the primary goal of this surgery which is treating obesity- a life threatening disease. Your first goal should be your health going into this. If it is, I think you‚Äôre more likely to be successful.  APickyveggieeater Thank you! Needed to hear this!  "

I also have never had any health issues other than PCOS and a prediabetes scare.\n \n My surgeon's instructions are pretty straightforward (see instructions on bottom of post) but I feel like I might be doing it wrong. I have my protein shake and I typically pair it with a cup of broth, I'm worried about how prepare the broth. I add about a serving size of chicken bullion (knorrs) and a good portion (maybe 2 tablespoons) of lemon juice to it. I feel like the salt is gonna retain my water and screw with my liver. I also feel like the lemon juice is somehow gonna screw with it. Am I overthinking it?\n \n EDIT: I do use low sodium broth!\n \n DRINK A PROTEIN SHAKE 3 TIMES PER DAY.\n \n IN BETWEEN EACH SHAKE YOU CAN HAVE A LOW-FAT YOGURT, A SMALL CUP OF BROTH (SOUP), AND IF NEEDED, A SMALL SALAD WITH LIGHT DRESSING.\n \n FOR THE PROTEIN SHAKE, YOU MAY MIX IT WITH LOW-FAT/NONFAT MILK, ALMOND MILK, WATER, OR LIGHT APPLE JUICE.",
    "answer": "Yes, you‚Äôre overthinking. For one thing- liver reduction is just fat loss. Fat loss is an independent process from water retention. The two tend to be linked because water retention can hide fat loss on the scale (you may lose a pound of fat but if you retain a pound of water your weight on the scale won‚Äôt change). For another thing- sodium causes water retention only under certain circumstances- specifically when you increase your sodium intake substantially and you‚Äôre dehydrated. As long as you‚Äôre drinking enough, the sodium from the broth is not going to cause any problems. "

Yesterday, Friday, I felt pretty good and just my incisions were sore. I got some egg drop soup and strained the egg, and ate less than 1/4 cup (there was at least an oz left in the bowl when I was done) slowly over the course of about an hour. I initially felt really good, I hadn‚Äôt been getting many calories or protein at all so that broth felt good for my body and brain! But then by the time bedtime came, I still felt uncomfortably full. I just woke up and still feel painfully full. It‚Äôs nothing horribly painful, but constantly uncomfortable.

    "answer": "You did not rip your staples with egg drop soup‚Äî you would have thrown it up instead. Liquids run through unless it‚Äôs too much at once, and in that case it backs up causing chest pain and upchuck (basically overflowing a bottle). It‚Äôs VERY swollen in there and those sensations will continue to evolve. Constantly feeling uncomfortable sounds pretty much on target for the whole situation. There will be a lot of new sensations in the days to come. Actually having your stomach be full will likely be felt as pain behind your sternum- sharp or dull.

I'll be starting the 2 week pre op liquid liver shrinking diet here soon and was wondering if caffeine coffee is allowed? Does anyone have a good list of what I should eat so I don't take the wrong thing? Thank you",
    "answer": "Your program should have given you a list. Double check the files you have and then reach out to them. At almost 2 weeks away from your surgery, you shouldn‚Äôt have any questions about what is and is not allowed at the different stages. And if you do have questions- you need to communicate with your surgeon‚Äôs office. In general, caffeine is not allowed for at least the first couple of weeks post op. This is because caffeine is a mild diuretic and during those first couple of weeks, meeting your hydration goal can be a struggle. So your surgeon doesn‚Äôt want you drinking anything that may increase your chances of being dehydrated. The other reason is that most caffeine drinks are acidic and many programs restrict acidic beverages to reduce risk of acid reflux post-op. So, because almost all programs have some moratorium on caffeine post-op, most programs also recommend you wean yourself off caffeine during the pre-op diet, if not before. This way you aren‚Äôt dealing with caffeine withdrawal as you‚Äôre also recovering from surgery. "

    "title": "4 Weeks Post Op - Please Help!",
    "question": "Hi everyone,\n \n I had a sleeve surgery 4 weeks ago (October 29th) and have been struggling just this past week. I was doing great for the first 3 weeks - able to get my protein in, fluid intake, followed all post-op diet stages and everything. I was finally starting to feel great.\n \n Last Sunday, I randomly was having troubles tolerating any liquids or food. I didn‚Äôt defer from my diet that I had been eating or do anything different to cause the sudden change. I was still able to get down about 15-20 oz of electrolytes and 2 oz of cottage cheese through the course of the day but that was me having to force every single sip into a stomach that was aching and cramping. I thought maybe it just wasn‚Äôt a good day for me as I‚Äôve seen a lot of people saying sometimes that can just happen. I woke up Monday and it was the same thing but also I had major nausea which is something I luckily have no dealt with at all post-op other than first day or two. I tried so hard just to focus on even getting any fluids in and set timers on my phone and tried to push through the nausea and stomach cramping. Tuesday was the same thing. I was able to get about 10-15 oz of a sugar free Gatorade (which is what I‚Äôve been able to tolerate the best so far post-op) and I booked in for a vitamin IV at a local naturopath. I was hoping to do one for hydration but where I am they only have that option in the emergency room. The naturopath also prescribed me zofran for the nausea and that seemed to help immensely with that since then. Wednesday I was hopeful that maybe it would be better after the IV but nothing changed - I called my surgeon and he suggested to double my Pantoprazole (40 mg - so now 80 mg a day) as I randomly started to get major heartburn and to go back to clear fluids for a couple days and take small sips every 5 minutes. The stomach cramping from ingesting literally anything was so bad it was making me sob, I‚Äôve never felt that kind of pain in my life. I listened to his suggestion Wednesday and Thursday and set timers and drank as much as I possibly could and dealt with the stomach cramping. He said if I could not up my fluids still then I would need to go to to ER to see if something else was going on and to get IV fluids. I went today - waited literally 9 hours and got the usual blood work done, CT scan, ECG, and nothing is out of the ordinary. The doctor prescribed me a few pain pills and some more zofran and suggested to take them before I try to eat or drink again. I did get one bag of IV fluid, he would not give me any more than that despite being obviously dehydrated. I could not urinate all day, I have not had a bowel movement or eaten any actual protein or calories in 5 days as my surgeon wants just clear liquids focused on for hydration. My only saving grace is that I have not been throwing up, not even once.\n \n I‚Äôm really struggling mentally right now. I don‚Äôt see an end in sight to this - it seems like my only real option is to attempt to continue to get in fluids and just fight through the extreme stomach cramping. I‚Äôm worried I‚Äôm not going to get enough liquids everyday and my body feels like I‚Äôm STARVING right now but surgeon is still recommending to focus on clear liquids.\n \n Does anybody have any insight? I‚Äôm feeling really alone right now and having bad mental thoughts. Is there anything that worked for you or that you could suggest that could save me here???",
    "answer": "I have suffered from IBS for years and there are a couple of things you could try that could ease the cramping. I know it‚Äôs really really painful and awful. Consider: herbal teas such as peppermint, ginger or chamomile tea. Peppermint is particularly good. You can make them and let them cool as well. sometimes the pain can be gas. There are over the counter products that can help such as buscopan, de gas or charcoal. Obviously check this is ok. pain relief - definitely use this as it will help the cramping pain. Sometimes it can be a phase that will pass in time. It could be something you ate that you are now sensitive  to. "

( I‚Äôm already on biotin and hitting my water/ protein goals.)\n \n \n \n When did you start losing hair?\n \n \n \n How long did it last for?\n \n \n \n Did it eventually stop?\n \n \n \n Did it start growing back?\n \n \n \n I know this can happen and thankfully I have thick long hair so losing some so far has been okay, but just wondering what some of your experiences have been! Thank you in advance :)",
    "answer": "Hello! I lost a decent amount of my hair, I started noticing it at around the 6 month post op mark. I actually thought I‚Äôd got away with it not happening me to be honest! I‚Äôm lucky to have ‚Äòfine hair but a lot of it‚Äô (as my hairdresser describes it!) so I others didn‚Äôt notice it thinning as much. The regrowth stage was sometimes annoying as my hair seemed ‚Äòflyaway‚Äô, fluffy on top/frizzy and looked like it was broken when it was regrowth making my hair different lengths. Mine has fully grown back now but it took about 18 months.  Individual_Olive_369 Thank you for sharing üôÇ  "

    "answer": "Don't buy a bunch of the same kind of protein shakes or powders; you're going to get sick of them really fast (said as someone who has bags upon bags of protein powder in the pantry). Like another commentor mentioned, an abdominal binder was really helpful for me. They gave it to me at the hospital, so check and see if that's an option for you. For the first ten days, until I started pur√©es, I mostly slept. I had no energy until I could eat something more substantial. "

However, I was only able to drink the protein shakes very very slowly(6 hours to finish 1?) But today, I‚Äôm currently at work and I bought an egg drop soup at lunch from the hospital I work at and I was able to finish the whole thing almost and I feel fine? The container it was in said 12oz(but it was probably filled up to 9/10oz) however, I definitely had about 6-7oz in one sitting. Is this normal? Should I be worried? I feel like I over-ate but I feel fine? Idk. I was expecting myself to only be able to have 2-3 spoonfuls at a time.",

Usual-Sea6413 Okay thank you, I got scared when I noticed that I was able to drink the whole cup in one sitting when at home I can‚Äôt even do more than 3 sips of protein. Also, when I drink cold water I feel it move down my stomach and into my intestines immediately after? Is that normal?

    "title": "Reactive Hypoglycemia?",
    "question": "7 wks out. Didn‚Äôt feel like eating much today. Tried some protein coffee but my gut wasn‚Äôt having it. Likely had 6 oz. Then for lunch had 4 oz of turkey with gravy and 1 tablespoon cranberry orange relish. I didn‚Äôt feel like having dinner and made a smoothie that I think did me in. Unsweetened almond milk, scoop of Isopure, fresh spinach, half small banana, 10 frozen blueberries. 90 min later I was sweating, palpitating, and feeling faint. Spouse loaded me up with a string cheese and 2 slices of deli turkey and I feel better. I know I barely ate today, didn‚Äôt meet my fluid or protein goals but this was my first time trying fruit. Was it too much? Should I only eat one fruit at a time?",
    "answer": "The fruit isn‚Äôt the problem- it‚Äôs everything leading up to the smoothie and how you introduced the fruit. Because you didn‚Äôt drink or eat nearly enough during the day, you were likely very dehydrated and slightly hypoglycemic already before dinner. The fruit on its own probably wouldn‚Äôt have been a problem, but in a smoothie you were able to consume the carbs a lot faster than you normally would have. In the future, on days like that- because these days will happen again, first drink 16 ounces of something. Wait your 30 minutes, then eat actual food. Even if it‚Äôs just half an apple with some nut butter. Actually eating will slow down how quickly things enter your blood stream. Think about it- that cranberry relish had as much if not more sugar than your smoothie. But it didn‚Äôt cause problems, why? Because you ate it slowly with 4 ounces of turkey.

    "question": "7 months post op.\n \n Like not hate hate but now I don‚Äôt want to eat most of the time. Staying hydrated is more important to me and when I eat I get thirsty. Since I can‚Äôt drink and feel de-hydrated for a while, I don‚Äôt like the idea of eating. I feel the effects of hangry on water if that makes sense ahshah\n \n I do snack and I do eat, not like that I am not eating anything but mostly 2 meals per day and those meals are few spoons of something and I am a-okay.\n \n I also have the opposite for 1-2 maybe 3 days a month, I feel genuienly hungry and eat maybe 4 meals and snack a lot more. But after that, I am back to disliking food.\n \n Am I the only one?",
    "answer": "Food apathy is the ‚Äúloss of hunger hormones‚Äù that is advertised as part of the process. It‚Äôs hormonal but it‚Äôs temporary, and hunger will likely be back by the end of year 1. Some people experience it as being absolutely repulsed by the idea of food and that‚Äôs not great. Eat anyway. Make sure you‚Äôre getting your full protein and water in no matter what. It‚Äôs kind of a balance for all of the crap food you ate for no reason whatsoever‚Äî a mental break of getting to carefully calibrate what you eat based on rational decisions. By the time hunger comes back, you have developed some new habits and a solid understanding that you simply don‚Äôt NEED to eat the way you did prior to surgery. Most people are at around 1000 calories a day by 7mo, so make sure you‚Äôre in with the cool kids on that.  bozcelebii Thanks! This was eye-opening.  "
